I have a CSV file (~1,000 rows) with columns like:
project_id
country
type (values include: objective, intervention, outcome)
category (may contain multiple categories in one cell separated by commas and/or semicolons, e.g. "crop management, technology & R&D" or "Policy & Regulatory; Environmental Sustainability")

Goal:
Create TWO separate pivot tables (presence/absence only):
  1.) interventions pivot
  2.) outcomes pivot

Requirements:
  1.) Load input.csv into pandas.
  2.) Filter OUT rows where type is "objective" (objectives have no usable category).
  3.) Clean and normalize the category field:
      - treat both , and ; as delimiters
      - split into multiple categories
      - trim whitespace
      - drop empty category values
  4.) Expand (explode) so each project–category pairing is its own row.
  5.) Create a project label column with this exact logic:
      - If a project_id is associated with exactly one unique country → label as PROJECT_ID (Country)
      - If a project_id is associated with more than one unique country → label as PROJECT_ID (multiple)
  6.) For each of the two datasets (intervention and outcome), build a pivot table where:
      - Rows = the project label created above
      - Columns = each unique individual category
      - Values = 0/1 presence (1 if that category appears at least once for that project, else 0, not counts)

  7.) Fill all missing values with 0 and ensure the table contains only integers (0 or 1).
  8.) Export:
      - intervention_category_pivot.csv
      - outcome_category_pivot.csv
  9.) Also export a QA file category_dictionary.csv containing:
      - each unique cleaned category
      - total number of exploded rows it appears in
  10.) Add basic QA prints:
      - number of input rows
      - number of rows after filtering objectives
      - number of rows after exploding categories
      - number of unique projects in interventions and outcomes
      - number of unique categories total
  11.) Write clean, well-commented code in a single script file (e.g., make_pivots.py) and include a main() so I can run:
python make_pivots.py

Assume the input file is named input.csv in the same folder as the script.
