TRACE is a hybrid Trust Fund (TF), financed by a Dutch contribution of US$23.1M, and will be implemented until the end of 2026. The program's development objective is to create jobs in the agri-food sector by strengthening the productivity and resilience of small- scale producers, and competitiveness of agribusiness cooperatives and SMEs in selected agri-food sub-sectors through better access to knowledge, innovations, and financial services. To stimulate job creation, TRACE acts on four dimensions: (i) addressing the mismatch between the supply and demand of skills in the agri-food sector; (ii) expanding the network and professionalism of producer organizations and agri-SMEs able to connect producers to market opportunities and required services; (iii) developing the range and quality of financial and non-financial services for farmers, agribusiness SMEs, and value chain stakeholders; and (iv) improving the business environment and policy framework to stimulate the growth of a market-oriented and private sector-driven agri-food sector. Activities under Dimensions 1, 3 and 4 are Bank-Executed TF (BETF) activities. Under Dimension 2, it is proposed to establish a fourth entrepreneurship support matching grant project to continue supporting Producer Organizations (POs) and small Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to develop their business and create more jobs through technical and financial assistance. This proposed project will be implemented by Microfinanza as a Recipient-Executed Trust Fund (RETF) project. The proposed RETF project will cover the four governorates in the North-West of Tunisia and capitalize on the activities previously undertaken by two other TRACE RETF projects (P174017 & P175641) in the same region. The proposed RETF project will be composed of three components:Component 1 - Technical assistance to POs and SMEsThe implementation of the entrepreneurship support project will require technical assistance (TA) to SMEs and POs for preparing and selecting technically sound and financially and commercially viable beneficiary sub-projects. Microfinanza – the implementing agency – will deliver this TA directly or through technical partners. The agency will disseminate information to potential POs and SMEs, with a special focus for youth and women entrepreneurs, to select candidates through both an open counter system and calls for proposals depending on the target. This dissemination will include facilitating the dialogue with relevant authorities, private sector associations, and other stakeholders to ensure that the investment sub-project submissions are consistent with the nature of the region and the opportunities and constraints of the sector. The Project will help POs and SMEs develop technically sound and commercially viable businesses through tailored TA. This TA will be delivered individually or in cohorts, based on the specific needs and maturity of the applicants’ sub-projects. The TA will ensure that investment sub-project proposals submitted to the Project have a strong potential to be profitable and sustainable, ensuring business growth and creating jobs, while also improving producers’ resilience and economic inclusion.To ensure the success of selected investment sub-projects, the implementing agency will also provide TA during implementation, either directly or by linking POs and SMEs with specialized technical and managerial expertise. The implementing agency will provide this second phase of TA directly and/or act as a facilitator to help POs and SMEs access additional support from public and private service providers and connect with larger business enterprises and agro-industries to receive advice in order to properly adjust to market requirements. The assistance will be provided individually to more developed POs and SMEs as a form of acceleration support, while less developed POs and SMEs will be grouped into cohorts to achieve economies of scale in the incubation of their initiatives. The overall objective of the technical assistance is to professionalize and expand businesses, increase bargaining power in value chains, improve financial and technical resources, and network to share experiences and best practices. Increasing the scale, productivity, and resilience of business activities will ensure sustainability of the jobs created and will generate additional jobs over time, while indirectly generating job creation for suppliers and clients of the POs and SMEs supported.Component 2 - Grants for agri-food and rural job creation The TRACE entrepreneurship support project will provide non-reimbursable financial contributions (matching grants) to investment sub-projects submitted by POs and SMEs engaged in agri-business activities with the overall objective to help business growth and job creation. For more developed candidates that receive acceleration support, matching grants will be capped to 30% of the cost of the proposed investments. Furthermore, this category of beneficiaries will be required to obtain credit from a bank, leasing company and/or supplier. The maximum grant size for acceleration beneficiaries will be 90,000 TND. For less developed candidates that receive incubation support, grants will be capped to 90% of the cost of the proposed investments. Obtaining credit will be encouraged, but it will not be a requirement for this category of beneficiaries. The maximum grant size for incubation beneficiaries will be 20,000 TND for SMEs and 70,000 TND for POs. For both categories of beneficiaries, the grants will finance small-scale equipment and inputs as well as soft activities (technical and managerial training and advice, marketing guidance and market intelligence, etc.).Eligible activities will cover the wide range of opportunities offered by the agri-food sector and agro-rural entrepreneurship. These activities can range from farming production and processing to agro-service providers (input and technology supplies, advisory services, etc.) and post-harvest operations (storage, processing, packing, etc.). Eligible investment initiatives also include the valorization of cultural and natural resources through handy crafts and rural tourism. Investment sub-projects will therefore be in, but not limited to, agro-industry, agro-food, apiculture, aromatic and medicinal plants, valorization of natural resources, and agro-tourism.Selection will prioritize investments with high job creation potential that are technically sound, commercially viable and environmentally and socially sustainable. Other factors to be considered include tangible scale, identified markets, and partnerships with other producers, private aggregators, agro-industries and other commercial entities. Selection will be done through an open counter system and competitive calls for proposals with differentiated criteria and financing thresholds depending on the type of beneficiary and the type of support (incubation or acceleration). Applicants will benefit from technical assistance delivered by the Project to improve the quality of proposals. SMEs and POs which have been successful in achieving 70% of the objective of their first investment projects and continue to have a high potential for job creation will be eligible for a second grant without going through the competitive selection process. The objective is to ensure impact sustainability and encourage successful SMEs and POs to continue creating jobs. A regional Technical Committee will be responsible of the selection of incubation proposals and monitoring of their implementation. It will include representatives from regional governmental entities, experts, and private sector representatives. The Technical Comm"

It contributes to food security and provides resources such as meat, milk, cash income, clothing, employment, and capital stock, and it also represents social status. Land cultivation and livestock rearing are the primary livelihood activities for many households, with approximately 81 percent cultivating land and 74 percent owning livestock. The country's livestock is valued at around 2.2 billion dollars with the livestock population at roughly 38.4 million animals, including 11.8 million cattle, 14 million goats, and 12.6 million sheep . Livestock Production predominantly occurs in arid- and semi-arid zones like Eastern Equatoria and the greater Barh el Ghazal regions. Animals are important assets for agro-pastoral communities, often sold for cash or bartered for goods despite slow growth of cross border trade in livestock being hampered by the current civil war in Sudan.Despite its magnitude and significance, the South Sudanese livestock sector does not meet its potential on food security, nutrition, and livelihoods. The sector has immense potential to increase food security and reduce malnutrition, employ a large segment of the population and foster income and national GDP growth. However, due to the long neglect and low investment in the livestock sector , sectoral development gaps are huge. Prevalence of livestock diseases and related animal health challenges and the severe erosion of rangelands and water resources preclude the sector from reaching a productivity level to enhance commercial opportunities around livestock value chains.The development of the livestock sector as a sustained source of food security and decent livelihood is structurally constrained by interlinked challenges. Main challenges are intrinsic to livestock development: poor animal health and high prevalence of diseases compounded by eroded rangelands lead to minimal productivity. Cross-cutting, foundational issues related to gender inequality, fragility and conflict, and institutional misalignments amplify the sectoral difficulties. Beyond economic growth, investing in agriculture is about resilience; resilience to climate change, resilience to market shocks, and resilience in ensuring that communities have access to nutritious food. Therefore, the sustainable development of the livestock sector hinges on solutions that address the technical issues while mainstreaming cross-cutting issues. The main challenges that the project will tackle are: (i) South Sudan suffers from chronic food insecurity and high level of malnutrition despite a large livestock population that is not productive because of poor animal heath, that causes also human health security and precarious livelihoods; (ii) high vulnerability of the livestock sector to climate change’s impact over water and fodder availability which threatens the livelihoods of pastoral and agro-pastoral communities that are relying on these rangelands for grazing and food; (iii) weak governance and regulatory frameworks characterized by inadequate human resource, insufficient budgets and the absence of a robust regulatory framework make access to and competition over natural resources cause unregulated movement of livestock and the spread of zoonotic diseases; (iv) limited participation of women while they are primarily responsible for animal care, including health monitoring and milking, alongside their duties of managing household responsibilities in the livestock sector is a big hindrance to the development of the sector; and (v) South Sudan is one of the most fragile countries in the world and is exposed to multiple risks of fragility, conflict, and violence that are affecting the livestock sector.The proposed project will address these challenges by supporting the government to invest in (i) animal health to enhance the health and thus the production and productivity of the animals through the provision of technical assistance and vaccines, (ii) improved natural rangeland management, resilient livestock production and adoption of enabling livestock policy bills to facilitate an integrated sector."

The proposed project aims to address three critical constraints to improved livelihoods of smallholder livestock keepers in Cambodia. The constraints are (i) low productivity, (ii) low incomes, and (iii) loss of livelihood from animal diseases and climate hazards. First, the project will promote adoption of climate-smart technologies to improve productivity, resilience, and climate mitigation. Second the project will enhance commercialization through better market access, value chain infrastructure, and stronger producer groups. Finally, it will protect smallholder productivity gains by improving animal health services, thereby reducing disease risks. The project will prioritize three livestock value chains, namely cattle, pigs, and poultry in three provinces - Battambang, Tbong Khmum, and Kampong Speu. The project has three components: Component 1 - Promote Inclusive and sustainable Livestock Value Chains: This component aims to sustainably improve the productivity of livestock production and orient farmers towards commercial production. This will be done through (i) the promotion of improved climate-smart technologies and practices, (ii) strengthening producer organizations, (iii) upgrading select, strategic value chain infrastructure, and (iv) improving linkages between producer organizations and agribusinesses for enhanced marketing of produce. Sub-component 1.1. Enhancement of livestock productivity. This sub-component will enhance the productivity, efficiency and sustainability of livestock production through; (i) providing grant co-funding to promote the uptake of climate smart technology and practice packages (PaTecs), which include (a) breeding, (b) feed and fodder production, (c) Good Animal Husbandry Practice (GAHP), and (d) animal waste management; and (ii) supporting the functioning of existing producer groups (PGs) and orienting them towards more commercial livestock production through technical assistance. Sub-component 1.2. Promoting smallholder market access. This sub-component will improve smallholder farmers’ access to markets and increase livestock product sales and farmer incomes through (i) facilitating multi-stakeholder engagement opportunities and exposure visits for small-medium enterprises (SMEs), PGs, and farmers to build and manage business/market partnerships; and (ii) upgrading strategic value chain infrastructure, such as slaughterhouses, and market facilities to higher food safety quality standards. Component 2. Enhance animal production and health services. This component will improve national and sub-national capacities to deliver effective and consistent extension and animal health services. This will be achieved through; (i) demonstration farms to showcase improved technologies and practices, (ii) strengthening extension service capacity to promote technology packages in livestock production; and (iii) building the capacity of General Directorate of Animal Health and Production (GDAHP), provincial offices, and village animal health workers to deliver quality animal health services and (iv) strengthening the surveillance system for transboundary animal diseases and zoonoses. Sub-component 2.1. Strengthening animal production service delivery capacity. The project will enhance extension service capacity to promote technology packages in livestock production. The project will support demonstration farms, capacity building of agriculture extension officers and commune agriculture officers, and the development and dissemination of Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) material. Sub-component 2.2. Strengthening animal health service delivery capacity. This sub-component will increase the capacity of national and local institutions to deliver veterinary services and track and manage animal diseases and zoonoses. The project will finance (i) strengthening of capacities of national and local institutions like MAFF, GDAHP, POAHPs, CAOs, and VAHWs to deliver veterinary services through bolstering the workforce, skills, and incentives for last-mile service providers, and (ii) strengthening of disease surveillance and response capacities for prevalent TADs and zoonoses in project locations, through an enhanced local surveillance system. Component 3. Project management and monitoring, evaluation, and learning. This component will ensure effective project implementation to achieve the PDO and set indicators and comply with the World Bank’s environmental, social, and fiduciary requirements. Key activities will be: (i) supporting the day-to-day implementation, coordination, and management of project activities, including planning and execution, financial management (FM), procurement, internal and external audits, and Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) management; and (ii) establishing and operating an effective project monitoring, evaluation and learning system for project management and planning purposes. Geographical targeting. The project will operate in three provinces. These include Battambang and Tbong Khmum, which are cross-border entry points, where incursions of transboundary animal diseases such as Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) and African Swine Fever (ASF), first occurred, thereby providing early warning to the rest of the country against major disease outbreaks, and Kampong Speu, which is an important center of livestock production, which has high livestock density and major animal trade, and is therefore a high-risk area. Beneficiaries targeting. The project’s direct beneficiaries will total about 30,000 - including farmers, staff of GDAHP, POAHP, MoH, MoE, VAHWs, Commune Agriculture Officers (CAOs), traders, and agribusinesses including female (40 percent). The project will mostly target smallholder farmers with high productive and commercialization potential, while also supporting a smaller segment of lower capacity farmers through PGs who exhibit potential and interest to develop their livestock business. The project will also support SMEs that are interested in cooperating with farmers and PGs. The project targeting strategy will include targeted information campaigns to reach out to farmers, including women and business owners, using a transparent, participatory and self-selection processes as has been successfully implemented in Cambodia, e. g. under the Cambodia Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development Project III (LASED III) and the Cambodia Agricultural Sector Diversification Project (CASDP). Additional indirect beneficiaries will be users of upgraded strategic value chain infrastructure, such as slaughterhouses, and market facilities to higher food safety quality standards, and rural communities, who will have better access to animal health and extension services and information. Institutional and implementation arrangements. MAFF will lead project implementation as the implementing agency (IA) via the GDAHP and related technical departments at the national level, alongside the Provincial Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (PDAFF) and POAHP. The IA has established a project management team (PMT), which is led by a Project Director and includes a deputy director, relevant technical experts, administration, procurement, finance, environmental and social standard (ESS), and M&E experts from relevant units of GDAHP and MAFF. The PMT will be responsible for the overall management of project implementation and external communication, including the agreed reporting to the World Bank. The PMT will be physically located in MAFF. A project implementation team (PIT) will be established to support the planning and executing daily activities. During implementation, the IA, through the PIT, will draw on technical expertise and advice from broader MAFF departments and relevant ministries like the MoE and MoH to implement"

The component aims to improve the grassland sector resilience and adaptation to climate change through: (i) strengthening grasslands capacity for carbon sequestration, maintain and improve existing carbon stocks, boost biodiversity dependent on grassland ecosystem, and contribute towards the global public goods (GPGs) and (ii) enhancing the quality and net primary productivity (NPP) of grasslands as a livestock feed base, helping to improve value chain participants’ access to sustainable and organic food markets. The project will finance infrastructure for grassland improvement, as we as training, demonstrations and extension to support introduction of carbon-capture and carbon-retention grassland management technologies and practices. The specific sites for grassland interventions would be selected during the project preparation using the criteria such as level of degradation, as well as significance for livestock grazing, potential to enhance carbon stock, support to livelihoods of farmers and herders, and improved livestock quality and health. Component 2: Strengthening sustainability and emission reductions in the livestock value chains.Sub-component 2.1: Promoting low emission and resilient livestock production. This Sub-component would support the province’s efforts to promote the overall greening of the main livestock value chains being developed in the different counties. For this, the adoption of efficient emission-reducing practices and technologies would be piloted in selected, representative intensive production enterprises, which would serve as demonstration units for the dissemination of these improved, environmentally-friendly mitigation practices to other existing and new enterprises, as well as extensionists and private technicians throughout the province. In order to address the entire value chain, thus ensuring the reduced carbon nature of the end products, the promotion of best practices would be supported in breeding grassland-based farms (see Component 1), as well as selected intensive production enterprises, feed supply operations, and processing facilities. Based on the relative importance of livestock production in the province, the value chains to be targeted are sheep, beef and dairy. Subcomponent 2.2: Strengthening of animal health and food safety aspects of the livestock value chains. This component aims to enhance the capacity for preparedness and response, prevention, and control, and minimize risks and impact of priority zoonotic diseases and transboundary animal diseases and other health threats.

One plank of the proposed support will focus on short term interventions targeting the most vulnerable population. These interventions include: (i) replenishment of the national food security reserve, from which part of the stock will be distributed to vulnerable populations; (ii) animal feed distribution to vulnerable livestock owners; and (iii) procurement and distribution of nutritional supplements to prevent and manage malnutrition. The second pillar of support will focus on the more medium-term interventions to strengthen the resilience and productive capacities of smallholder’s producers to increase production of own food crops and livestock, including: (i) expanding access to quality production inputs (e.g., improved drought resistant seeds, fertilizers/compost); and (ii) improving access to small post-harvest management equipment. Changes to the parent project (the Burkina Faso element) as described below are proposed:Changes to project activities and costs: A total of US$12.1 million in AF resources is allocated to Component 2 (Sustainable landscape management and governance enhancement). Of this, US$1.4 million is allocated to subcomponent 2.1 (Access to natural resources and SLM) to finance a new activity - the construction of 2 biodigesters close to the slaughterhouses in Bobo Dioulasso and Kaya to produce compost/manure for use as a soil fertility amendment in crop production. The manure would be distributed to farmers by the regional directorates in charge of Agriculture in each targeted region based on eligibility criteria to be detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). Besides helping improve soil fertility for increased production, the biodigesters, each with estimated capacity to produce at least 500 tons of compost per year would also help mitigate methane emissions that would have otherwise escaped from the pits where slaughterhouse waste is currently left to decompose. Under subcomponent 2.2 (Sustainable management of infrastructure for access to water), the parent project finances the construction of pastoral water points in rangelands with no or limited access to water, to ensure the sustainable access of pastoralists to new grazing areas and natural forage resources, and to improve capacity to adapt to climate change. Even with current support, significant gaps in availability of water for both agricultural (crop and livestock production) and household use would persist. The proposal is to allocate US$1.7 million in AF resources to scale up parent project support towards water infrastructure. Specifically, the AF will finance the rehabilitation of 60 climate resilient water points (16 simplified water supply systems, 35 manual boreholes and 9 watering pounds) and the construction of nine (09) boreholes for fodder crops irrigation to protect against climate-induced water scarcity. As in the parent project, the management of this infrastructure would be under the control of beneficiary communities.Another US$9.0 million in AF resources will be committed to subcomponent 2.3 (Fodder production) to scale up parent project support to increasing the availability and accessibility of cultivated fodder to complement the supply of grass - helping to secure pastoral farming and herd mobility and improving resilience. The AF will support the procurement and distribution of 2,100 tons of fertilizers, 750 tons of compost, 1,800 tons of drought resistant dual purpose crop germplasm (e.g., cowpea, sorghum, orange fleshed sweet potato, and maize, among others), as well as 900 tons of fodder crop seeds adapted to the agro-ecological conditions to help producers vulnerable from climate change to increase their food and fodder production. In complement, as new activities, the AF will support the production of compost by producers using locally available materials - where possible, and training on climate-smart production techniques and technologies in the framework of integrated soil fertility management. Additionally, US$9.9 million in AF resources will go towards subcomponent 3.3 (Value-chain development and subproject financing), to scale up parent project financing for improving livestock producer access to critical inputs and small productive assets. Unlike the parent project which under this subcomponent mainly targets producer organizations and the private sector, the A F will target vulnerable small-scale livestock producers, including those that are not part of producer organizations. The AF will support the acquisition and distribution of 13,650 tons of animal feeds, including 9,000 tons of agro-industrial by-products, 1,200 tons of fish feed, 1,950 tons of poultry feed, and 1,500 tons of licking stones. These inputs will be distributed at subsidized rates in compliance with existing government guidelines on inputs subsidies. The distribution will be done by the regional directorates in charge of agriculture and livestock production like the other ongoing projects in the agriculture sector. The AF will also support the improved postharvest management of project supported produce through provision of simple postharvest equipment (e.g., storage containers, cleaners, hand mills, shellers, seed removers, and root crop cutters/graters). Support under this activity will prioritize women, youth, and IDPs. This will diversify livelihoods vulnerable to climate change impacts. With the proposed changes the cost of Component 3 for Burkina Faso will increase to US$12.9 million.Lastly, the cost of Component 5 is increased by US$28.0 million. Of this, US$3.0 million would go towards supporting the coordination of the AF activities (subcomponent 5.1 – Project coordination) – including enhancing the technical and organizational capacity of the PIU, ensuring environmental and social safeguards compliance, effective M&E, procurement, FM, and communication, among others. US$25.0 million will go to subcomponent 5.2 (Institutional strengthening), and of this, US$24.0 million will go towards the procurement and delivery of 37,000 tons of food to replenish the national food-stock reserve. The reserve, managed by the National Food Security Stock Management Company (Societe nationale de gestion des stocks de securite alimentaire, SONAGESS), a state-owned national food security stock management enterprise is composed of major staple cereals: maize, rice, and sorghum/millet. Depending on prevailing market prices, procurement will be from local, regional, or international markets. Part of the purchased staple food will be distributed to the vulnerable households in targeted regions using the government existing mechanism. SONAGESS has demonstrated capacity to undertake the proposed food procurement and distribution as evidenced under other World Bank - financed projects . The use of IDA resources to purchase food in the current context is a productive investment as it would prevent the continued adoption of negative coping mechanisms by beneficiaries, including the desperate sale of assets. The balance of US$1.0 million will support the purchase and distribution of nutritional supplements to help address the high levels of malnutrition in children and pregnant and lactating women. This activity will be implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (Nutrition Directorate)."

The country experienced positive economic growth, but it has been largely driven by gold exports and worker remittances. Poverty in the country increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is increasingly impacting food affordability. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the poverty rate (US$3.2 a day, 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP)) from 9.7 percent in 2019 to 16.2 percent in 2020. Reduced labor income and remittances caused by the pandemic and inflation pushed an additional 700,000 people (11 percent of the population) into poverty and this trend is expected to increase with the poverty rate reaching 25.5 percent in 2022 (at the US$3.65 a day, 2017 PPP poverty line) from 21.8 percent in 2021. Food and fuel prices drove inflation to 11.2 percent in December 2021 from 9.7 percent a year ago but has fallen to 10.8 percent since February 2022. The uncertainties related to the geopolitical and global economic situation are expected to increase inflation in the Kyrgyz Republic to 15.5 percent, thus creating significant further pressure on fiscal and debt management as well as potentially pushing more people into poverty.Sector and Institutional ContextAgriculture is the main source of income and livelihoods in rural areas but is dominated by smallholders both upstream and downstream. The sector contributes about 12 percent to GDP and employs nearly 30 percent of all labor in the country. The sector consists mainly of small-scale production systems with over 470,000 farm units and more than 700,000 rural households that collectively produce over 95 percent of the total agricultural products in the country. Productivity remains below potential. Yields of major crops remain below Central Asia and ECA averages and while livestock numbers have been rising, productivity gains remain small due to low levels of investment, pasture degradation, livestock diseases and insufficient access to veterinary services. Limited access to improved seeds, fertilizer, farm equipment, extension services, and financing remain key challenges to improving productivity. The Kyrgyz Republic is a net exporter of a selected number of commodities (milk, potatoes, horticulture products) with the potential to expand exports if production can meet market requirements. Agri-food enterprises would benefit from improved processing equipment and facilities, and public support in this case would be limited to promoting innovation and modern technologies rather than granting new equipment to enterprises.Relationship to CPFThe proposed project is aligned to the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2019-2022 (Report No. 130399-KG), which seeks to promote diversified, export-oriented, inclusive, and sustainable growth in the Kyrgyz Republic and is focused on improving conditions for private sector growth. The proposed project falls under the CPF Focus Area 1: Strengthen foundations for inclusive private sector-led growth and Focus Area 3: Enhance economic opportunities and resilience. As preparation of the new CPF for 2024-28 is underway, the proposed project would directly contribute to the proposed High-Level Outcome 2 (HLO2) by addressing key constraints to improvements in agricultural productivity and increasing competitiveness of agri-food value chains by adopting climate-smart, modern technologies.Project Description SummaryThe PDO will be achieved through improving production processes and linkages in selected agri-food clusters, strengthening associated national and regional support systems, and promoting climate smart technologies and practices. The proposed project components are as follows:Component 1: Investment for Agri-food Clusters Development. This component would support investments in each selected agri-food cluster by financing producers and productive partnerships among producers and aggregators/processors engaged in production and value addition.Component 2: Strengthening Institutions and Systems. This component would provide support to public-sector service delivery for seeds and livestock breeding and information management. Following sub-components are included:Sub-component 2.1: Training and capacity building of agri-food clusters. This sub-component would support climate smart training and capacity building of beneficiaries including farmers and processing enterprises, and other participants in the targeted agri-food clusters. This sub-component would also provide training to relevant government agencies for improved services to the producers.Sub-component 2.2: Seed system improvement. This sub-component would support the enabling environment for policies, strategies, legal frameworks, standards, and organizations associated with seed and planting material.Sub-component 2.3: Improved livestock breeding and information management system. This sub-component would support improvement of animal breeding policies and regulations, development of a national dairy breeding plan, artificial insemination services, and strengthening of public services.Component 3: Operational support and project management. This component would support project implementation, including the project’s monitoring and evaluation system, communication strategy, preparation and implementation of environment and social framework instruments, training, and financing of incremental operating costs.Component 4: Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC). This is a zero-dollar component that will provide support in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency, including climate-related disasters, to reallocate project funds to support emergency response."

Resilience is defined as “The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions through risk management.” In the context of LLRP II, improving livelihood and climate resilience rests on enhancing the capacity of lowland PAP households, communities, and production systems to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform, or recover from climate shocks in a timely and efficient manner, while (and including by) ensuring the health and regeneration of lowland ecosystems and natural resources. Increases in production and productivity; better access to markets, roads, services, health, education, diversified diets, energy, and sustainable sources of income; and enhanced capacity to manage local resource-related conflicts are expected, among other improvements, to contribute to these outcomes. Annex 1 explains how livelihood and climate resilience will be measured by the project. Component 1: Pastoral Risk Management for Resilience (PRMR) (US$228 million, including US$184 million IDA and US$44 million IFAD)This component will enhance the absorptive and adaptive capacities of PAP communities and their ecosystems by strengthening DRM capacities and developing public infrastructure that supports disaster preparedness and climate resilience.Subcomponent 1.1: Strengthening Lowlands Early Warning and Response System and Climate Information Services (US$9 million, including US$7 million IDA and US$2 million IFAD) This subcomponent will finance activities that relate to strengthening the early warning and response system and CIS in Ethiopia’s lowlands with a focus on ‘last mile connectivity’. This focus will ensure that information and advice about impending climate change-exacerbated hazards (including drought, floods, conflicts, livestock disease outbreaks, higher temperatures, and pest infestations) reach households across PAP areas in a timely fashion. To strengthen the early warning and response system, the project will finance the preparation of Woreda Disaster Risk Profiles (WDRPs). In a process led by the Ethiopian Disaster Risk Management Commission (EDRMC), WDRPs will be prepared using participatory processes involving community representatives and key stakeholders at the woreda level. Experienced international organizations, such as the International Institute for Rural Reconstruction (IIRR), will facilitate the process and prepare a report using an interactive online platform to be hosted by the EDRMC. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), through the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) Project, will support the integration of climate information into WDRPs. The subcomponent will also (a) build the Government’s and community’s awareness of DRM; (b) support the EDRMC in rolling out the new Multi-Hazard, Impact-Based Early Warning and Early Action System (MH-IB-EW-EAS) roadmap for 2023–2030, in the lowlands, including by helping it develop region-specific implementation plans; (c) support the implementation of the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) in the lowlands by the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute (EMI); (d) strengthen partnerships and coordination among the Ministry of Irrigation and Lowlands (MILLs), EDRMC, and EMI, to ensure the successful implementation of the MH-IB-EW-EAS and NFCS in the lowlands; and (e) build the institutional, organizational, and human resource capacity of key stakeholders including the EDRMC and EMI (at the federal, regional, and woreda levels), with a focus on forecasting and last mile communications in the lowlands of Ethiopia. In relation to CIS, the project will build capacities to collect, analyze, process, and disseminate information. Subcomponent 1.2: Implementing Disaster Preparedness and Resilience Investments (US$219 million, including US$177 million IDA and US$42 million IFAD)This subcomponent will support the identification of, and selectively fund, a range of investments in climate-smart public economic infrastructure (PEI), that is, physical infrastructure that can help mitigate the impacts of climate-related (and other) hazards on PAP systems and communities. The identification, selection, planning and implementation of the PEI investments will follow three steps. These are (a) preparation Regional Disaster Preparedness and Resilience-building Strategic Investment Plans (DPRSIPs) for each of the eight project regions, (b) preparation of specific Climate-smart PEI investment plan for LLRP II, which will emanate from the wider DPRSIPs, and (c) implementation of Climate-smart PEI investments. Eligible climate-smart PEI investments to be financed under this subcomponent include the construction, upgrading, or rehabilitation of (i) drought-resilient water resource infrastructure for both human and livestock consumption (such as deep water well, small, and micro-dams), (ii) efficient and innovative small-scale irrigation schemes (up to 500 ha per scheme), (iii) all-weather feeder roads, (iv) cold storage and feed stores, (v) livestock market facilities, (vi) veterinary service facilities, and (vii) wetland and flood management works. The PEI investments will be strategically sited along key migration and trade corridors and water supply infrastructure will be sited with careful consideration of available grazing resources to avoid overgrazing and degradation in their vicinity. Component 2: Integrated Rangeland Management (IRM) (US$64.48 million, including US$52.16 million IDA and US$12.32 million IFAD)Building on the success of LLRP I, the project will continue to use rangelands as the entry point for investments. Component 2 aims to improve the absorptive and adaptive capacities of PAP ecosystems by monitoring and improving the health and productivity of natural rangeland resources (improving their soil stability, hydrologic function, vegetation productivity, and biotic integrity) and attenuate community-level conflict in PAP areas. Healthier and more productive rangelands, in turn, will increase livestock productivity, PAP households’ livelihoods, and PAP systems’ overall resilience. They will also increase above- and below-ground soil carbon stocks, contributing to climate change mitigation and resilience. To achieve these results, the component will apply integrated, participatory, nature-based, and climate-smart approaches and leverage renewable and efficient energy sources and technologies. It will also leverage selected research outputs and innovations generated by ILRI’s AICCRA Project on feed, pasture management, and integrated rangeland management in the lowlands. When possible, the project will promote NBS with guidance from the World Bank’s NBS Invest Program. The component will have three subcomponents. Subcomponent 2.1: Rangeland Health Monitoring and Institutional Capacity Building (US$4.35 million, including US$3.48 million IDA and US$0.87 million IFAD)The subcomponent will support (a) the establishment of a national rangeland monitoring system (RMS) and (b) rangeland monitoring and management institutions, proactively targeting women in capacity-building efforts. Subcomponent 2.2: Participatory Rangeland and Pasture Management (PRPM) (US$52.5 million, including US$42.5 million IDA and US$10.0 million IFAD)This subcomponent will support (a) the preparation of rangeland management plans (RMPs), (b) the implementation of rangeland and pasture development activities, and (c) the production and marketing of forage and feed. of fodder and feed production in PAP areas.

It will also build the capacity of other linked service providers to offer their services via the platform and maximize its use for their purposes as well as on the platform’s institutional and operational framework. The project will take a participatory approach for developing and delivering a stack of digital services. The project will help develop a Virtual Training Academy jointly with herders, livestock researchers, and practitioners in the sector. It is envisaged to form partnerships with existing institutions that already provide locally relevant extension content, such as for example the Mongolian University of Life Sciences and other institutions collaborating in the Responsible Cashmere Round Table (RCRT). The project will finance virtual cooperatives based on institutional performance criteria for availing high-quality services from technical assistance providers, common facilities center, acquiring small scale equipment and production facilities used for improving animal welfare or livestock product processing, working capital for collective production and market activities, etc. The delivery approach is mostly through forging partnerships with existing public and private actors and may include organizing an innovation challenge to crowdsource disruptive ideas for piloting service provision in the domain of virtual cooperatives. Collaborating with existing digital financial services providers the project will pilot design and distribute sustainable livestock finance products on a virtual cooperative platform to improve their outreach to isolated herder communities. This model for digital livestock finance will have a high potential to be replicated by other players; It will also develop partnerships with public and private players for delivering services through the platform. Offering an integrated interface and a one-stop point for fragmented services will help facilitate the convergence of public and private services. Finally, the project will prepare virtual cooperatives for participation in high impact value chains by promoting principles of animal welfare, sustainable livestock practices, grass-fed organic livestock, fair trade, and responsible sourcing mechanisms."

Reforms to strengthen public debt management and fiscal oversight of SOEs and related fiscal risks are crucial to address short-term macroeconomic vulnerabilities and risks to private investment. Increased access to international finance for firms can support private sector development and firm growth, and free up funds from lending to larger borrowers to smaller companies, thereby enhancing access to credit for smaller companies. Developing a vibrant private sector to generate jobs and diversify the economy, while sustaining Bhutan’s natural environment, will be crucial to build resilience and ensure green and inclusive development. In doing so, Bhutan can seize new opportunities, such as the acceleration of digital development and e-trade in goods and services, which can reduce the cost of distance and remoteness.

Subcomponent 2.1: Consolidate Regional Agricultural Innovation System - AF US$ 2.0 million GAFSP. The AF will scale-up research, innovation and extension services promoted under the parent project to invest in: i) equipment and knowledge related to vegetable farming in close collaboration with the National Center of Specialization in Fruits and Vegetables Burkina Faso; and ii) increased adoption of climate-smart practices and nutrition education- with a particular focus on youth and women. Climate-smart agriculture and nutrition education: To promote the adoption of climate-smart, gender- and nutrition-sensitive technologies in the targeted value chains, 400 extension workers8 will be trained in CSA practices and nutrition-smart agriculture, with an aim to specifically include women who are traditionally excluded from extension education. Following these trainings, they will be supported to establish farmer field schools and train farmers for the adoption of improved technologies. To foster gender-responsive nutrition education on the requirements of a safe, healthy, and diverse diet, the AF will build the capacity of 300 female trainers selected from the National Network of Women Farmers of Togo in the fields of food processing, storage (including to reduce risks of aflatoxin contamination), nutrition and food hygiene. Once trained, the women will establish a network of trainers who will replicate the training within their communities. Subcomponent 2.2: Strengthening Regional Food Security through Integrated Landscape Management (US$ 13.0 million). Under this sub-component, the AF will scale up existing activities to promote producers’ access to high quality inputs with a special focus on crops with high nutritional value and with special considerations for women, given that women frequently lack access to quality inputs. It will also add two new activities to support: i) households in the acquisition of improved breeds (poultry and small ruminants); ii) animal health; and iii) increased production and use of organic fertilizers and biopesticides. Vegetable production: To promote vegetable production, the AF will provide support to 2,600 producers (at least 60 percent of whom will be women) at a total of 60 sites to i) set up small-scale irrigation systems; and ii) access output markets. More specifically, the AF will support producers with irrigation kits based on solar pumping systems and support the drilling of the corresponding wells. These activities will focus on women, who traditionally lack access to agricultural assets. In addition, the AF will finance training sessions for women and youth on market access, and climate-resilient land management practices related to vegetable production and nutrition-smart agriculture under the responsibility of National Extension Agency, the Institute for Advice and Technical Support (ICAT). The trainings will be based on the establishment of supervised field schools or production plots using the farmer business school approach. In addition, nutrition education classes will be provided to producers. About 400 young people (40 percent women) will receive training on the maintenance of small irrigation infrastructure and equipment, facilitated through matching grants. Scale-up production of high nutritional value crops: To foster the production of crops with high nutritional value (orange-fleshed sweet potato, moringa, biofortified maize, cowpea and soybeans) and the increased use of organic fertilizers, 71,000 vulnerable producers, including 20,000 rice producers (60 percent women), 15,000 corn producers (40 percent women), 1,000 soybean producers (40 percent women), 20,000 market gardeners (60 percent women) and 15,000 cowpea producers (40 percent women) will be identified and supported with kits made up of subsidized seeds, fertilizers and biofertilizers. These kits will contribute to reducing gender gaps related to the use of agricultural inputs considering that female producers generally lack access to inputs. Seeds for food crops will be purchased primarily from the national network of certified seed producers in Togo (RNPSC-T)9. The kits will be distributed in accordance with arrangements put in place by the GoT as part of the inputs for grain program led by Togo's National Food Security Agency (ANSAT). Inputs will be delivered through a credit-based system where beneficiaries will receive inputs at the beginning of the planting season and pay back for the inputs in kind upon harvest. ANSAT will collect harvested products equivalent to the value of the inputs supplied to operate a revolving fund. This scheme facilitating access to inputs has already been implemented during past farming seasons with satisfactory results. It is being scaled up during the ongoing 2023-2024 farming season with the support of the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), the Kara agropole, the Food Crisis Response and Emergency Support Programme in Togo (PRCASUT) funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB) as well as the Project to Strengthen Food Systems for Sustainable Access to Agricultural Inputs for Small Producers (Pro-SADI) funded by the European Union and implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP). If feasible, the production of other drought resilient crops such as millet will also be supported. New activities on animal breeds and health: To improve livestock productivity and harness additional income generating opportunities, the AF will provide support for 2,000 beneficiaries (40 percent female) in acquiring improved livestock breeds and in improving animal health (vaccination campaigns for poultry and small ruminants) and animal shelter.10 Beneficiary households will be provided with about 800 poultry and 1200 small ruminants.

All these elements of project design have a great potential for peacebuilding in many parts of the conflict zones. The design of the project is also based on the nexus between natural resources degradation, climate change impacts, and social conflicts. In this context, implementing the Landscape Restoration Approach is required to face these challenges and break the current deadlock. This approach is recognized as an effective mitigation strategy by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and several experts due to its multiple adaptation and mitigation effects. The project-proposed landscape restoration activities contribute to achieving Mali’s commitments under the Land Degradation Neutrality and NDC. Since in Mali, communes’ territories are linked to specific socio-cultural-linguistic groups and ecosystems, it was agreed to consider the landscape unit equivalent to the commune territory. The Development Objective of the Project is to increase adoption of landscape restoration practices and enhance people’s lives in selected communes.The PDO Level Indicators• Land area under sustainable landscape management practices (CRI, Hectare [Ha])• People with increased benefits from natural resources, disaggregated by sex (Male/female)• Net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CRI, Metric tons CO2/year)• Target beneficiaries with rating “Satisfied” or above on project interventions (disaggregated by sex and age).The project is structured around three interdependent components that help achieve its development objective. Component 1 focuses on strengthening capacities, planning, and conflict prevention strategy. Component 2 focuses on promoting sustainable investment in (a) degraded landscapes to restore their physical and social functions, and (b) improving market access of NTFPs and fishery products through productive alliances. Component 3 focuses on project coordination, communication, and M&E. A fourth Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) is added to immediately respond to a potential crisis following a man-made or natural disaster.The project will preliminary target 87 communes selected based on criteria related to the consolidation / synergy with ongoing Bank projects (mainly PREEFN and PGRNCC); the Malian GGW interventions area; commune poverty profile; and ecosystem vulnerability (see technical background document). Additional communes, including in other regions, may be added using the same criteria.The project is structured around three interdependent components which contribute to achieve the project development objective. A fourth emergency response and contingency component is added to respond immediately to potential crisis following a human-made or natural disaster. Component 1 focuses on strengthening capacities, planning, and communication. Component 2 focuses on promoting sustainable investment (i) in landscapes to restore their physical and social functions including services and resilience capacity and to increase their productivity; and (ii) to enhance local population resilience by improving access of their FNTPs and fishery products to economic opportunities and markets by co-financing investments in Productive Alliances. Component 3 focuses on project coordination and monitoring and evaluation.• Component 1: Institutional support and Capacity Building for Landscape Restoration and Resilience (US$14 million)This component will support initiatives aimed at improving the capacities of all stakeholders in relation to the challenges of landscape development and resilience, improving the knowledge base about landscapes through specific studies, strengthening or updating integrated landscape development and forest and rangeland management plans and share knowledge through an appropriate communication strategy.Sub-component 1.1: Human and Institutional Capacity Strengthening (US$5.5 million)Capacity Strengthening initiatives will aim to: 1.1.1. Support capacity development (US$2 million) of stakeholders involved at national, regional and communal levels, including members of the Project Management Unit (PMU) (US$2 millions). 1.1.2. Enabling environment for mobilizing climate finance (US$3.5 million).

The rationale is that conservation and restoration of land and the pursuant efforts to manage that land sustainably can increase soil fertility, fodder, water, and ecosystem services, contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation through carbon sequestration in vegetation and soil, which in turn can increase land, resource, and livestock productivity, and protect biodiversity. Landscape restoration will aim to reconcile economic, social and environmental concerns within a holistic framework, with the best projects utilizing environmental improvements as drivers for socio-economic regeneration . It will enhance and diversify local livelihoods, improve food security, create climate-smart jobs, and increase resilience to the impact of climate change. Sub-component 2.1 Restoring landscapes and ecosystem services (US$70 million)While protecting pastoral and forest landscapes is important, restoring them where they have been lost and degraded is also necessary, necessary because without those landscape, soils, water and the goods and services provided by forests and pastoral resources are lost or impaired. Restoring these landscapes in the fragile and vulnerable context of targeted areas is about much more than returning trees to the landscape. It is about meeting both development and environmental priorities in a context that is primarily rural and predominantly low in terms of human development. Under this sub-component, the project will support restoration of key landscapes of the following ecosystems crossed by the GGWI belt in Mali: 2.1.1 Restoration of the Niger Inner Delta (NID) Landscapes (US$30 million)2.1.2 Restoration of other Landscapes crossed by the by the GGWI belt in Mali (US$30 million)2.1.3: Community integrated Agro-sylvo-pastoral farms (FACI) (US$10 millions)Sub-component 2.2 Improving local livelihoods (US$50 millions)2.2.1 Sustainable development of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) (US$35 millions)2.2.2 Community fishery (US$15 million)2.2.3 Strengthening local social and non-tangible capital of targeted communes (US$2 million)Component 3: Coordination and monitoring-evaluation (US$14 million)This component seeks to provide necessary support for the daily management of the project, and monitoring and evaluation of the field activities.

The Project also would also support other value chains e.g., pork, fisheries, and honey that could generate quick income for women and youth.The project addresses binding constraints to competitiveness and resilience in both traditional and improved sedentary production systems, focusing on: (i) strengthening the policy, institutional foundations, and service delivery for the subsector; (ii) improving productivity and value-added; and (iii) mainstreaming measures that promote mitigation and adaptation to climate change across the value chain segments. To achieve this, the project adopts a value chain approach focusing on both the upstream and downstream segments of the value chains – from on-farm production to marketing and distribution (including processing, cold storage, and transport). PRECEL recognizes the critical role of the private sector in strengthening the competitiveness of the livestock sector. With the view to attract private investment in the livestock sector, the project supports policy, regulatory and financial measures, and innovations as well as advisory services to ensure adequate private investment in various segments of the value chains. Access to finance is catalyzed through matching grants and business service support. Policy measures to rationalize public and private sector roles in the provision of veterinary services will be developed and implemented, leading increased participation of the private sector in provision of veterinary services wherever feasible. The project will partner with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to ensure complementarity in supporting the targeted livestock value chains.PRECEL seeks to overcome multiple challenges facing women in Burkina Faso’s livestock sector, especially those linked to access to inputs, and credit and financial services. All implementing partners will be required to proactively seek for opportunities ensure that project benefits flow to women. The project will support vulnerable conflict-affected livestock-keepers. Working in partnership with relevant national and international agencies, PRECEL will identify and provide relevant support to conflict internally displaced persons (IDP) in project areas with capacity to participate in project activities. In keeping with the WBG FCV Strategy, the aim is to boost resilience, expand access to productive assets, and create employment and income generating opportunities.Support will be provided for institutional capacities for climate adaptation and mitigation and reduction of greenhouse gas impact. The project trains small-scale producers as effective agents of environmentally sound practices. Building environmental resilience in close liaison with livestock producers is a core dimension of PRAPS-II and was emulated by PADEL-B.

The objective of this component is to improve the management and service delivery capacity of public institutions. The main areas of support under this component include: (i) improving the enabling environment, (ii) strengthening the capacity of the Committee of Veterinary and Livestock Development (CVLD), including the national network of laboratories (NNLs) and artificial insemination (AI) centers; (iii) strengthening livestock extension and advisory services; and (iv) strengthening research and development. Subcomponent 1.1: Improve the enabling environment. The objective of this subcomponent is to improve the policy and legal framework of livestock production in general and livestock marketing and international trade in particular. Subcomponent 1.2: Strengthen the CVLD’s management and service delivery capacity. The objective of this subcomponent is to improve the technical independence, coordination, management, and service delivery capacity of the CVLD. The current capacity of the CVLD is limited: it is not organized with relevant units/departments, and systems and procedures are either missing or poorly designed. The agency is underfunded, and lacks the requisite physical and human resources, including IT system to support its activities and improve coordination capacity. Subcomponent 1.3: Strengthen public livestock extension and advisory services. The objective of this subcomponent is to improve livestock extension and advisory service provision. Uzbekistan does not have a well-functioning livestock extension and advisory services. The lack of an effective system for disseminating climate smart knowledge and information (linking them with research and education) and effective advisory services to producers and other value chain actors in the livestock subsector is one of the most serious obstacles to the development of the subsector. Subcomponent 1.4: Strengthen public livestock research and development. The objective of this subcomponent is to build the capacity of selected public institutions involved in livestock research and development, including the Research Institute of Livestock Sector and Poultry Farming, Scientific Research Institute of Karakul sheep Breeding and Deserts Ecology, Research Institute of Aquaculture at the Research and Production Center of Livestock and Food supply of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan. There are also universities involved in livestock research and development. However, research and development institutions are seriously underfunded. Component 2: Strengthen market and value addition infrastructure and facilitate trade. The objective of this component is to improve the market access of livestock farmers and agribusinesses and improve international trade i.e., enhance import control of animals and animal products. Subcomponent 2.1: Strengthen livestock market and value addition infrastructures. The objective of this subcomponent is to improve the livestock market infrastructure so that the volume of livestock and livestock products sold is increased, the quality improved and the supply of healthy and quality livestock products ensured. Physical market infrastructure includes well-facilitated market centers, roads, and stock routes or slaughtering houses, processing plants, milk collection centers, etc. that are supported by a real-time market information system to enhance efficiency.Subcomponent 2.2: Strengthen border security and quarantine. The objective of this subcomponent is to enhance international trade by strengthening border security and quarantine. Border security and quarantine are important in controlling animal disease and facilitating international trade by preventing entry of animal diseases into the country as well as facilitating the export of disease-free animal and animal products. Border Inspection Points (BIP) and quarantine stations are critical in this regard. Subcomponent 2.3: Operationalize AIR&T system . The objective of this subcomponent is to support the Government of Uzbekistan in the implementation (rolling out) of the AI&T system in Uzbekistan.

The Albania Climate Resilience and Agriculture Development Project (CRAD) will contribute to Objective 3.2: “Depolluting the economy and better managing natural resources” for High Level Outcome 3 (HLO 3) “Enhanced resilience to climate change and natural risks and better management of natural resources”, as well as Objective 1.2: “Improved enabling environment for private sector growth” and Objective 1.3: “Improved quality and sustainability of public services” for HLO 1: ‘A more sustainable growth’. The proposed project is also highly consistent with the World Bank’s overall development frameworks – Resilience, Inclusion, Sustainability, and Efficiency (RISE) and World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan 2021–2025: Green, Resilient and Inclusive Development (GRID), in terms of addressing long-term development challenges and contributing to post pandemic build back better. The proposed Climate Resilience and Agriculture Development Project will work through an integrated approach that combines the promotion of the agri-food sector’s competitiveness with increased climate resilience and a more sustainable growth. The proposed project would include the following three components. Component 1 will focus on supporting resilient and climate smart agriculture, productivity improvements and improving market access through investments to shorten the value chain, strengthen resilience of food supply and develop a modern and reliable irrigation delivery services and drainage network for high-value agricultural production. The project would support (i) development of five Micro Food Hubs in the peri-urban areas of main cities in the regions of Tirana, Shkodra/Lezha, Vlora and Gjrokastra to provide better market access to local producers while supporting short supply chains and resiliency in urban food supply; (ii) development of two typical food product clusters in the regions of Berat and Dibra, to create the enabling environment for the valorization of two typical food products (olive oil and processed fruits and vegetables) through the aggregation of producers (consortium), and the improvement of quality and market access with the development of their technical and marketing capacity; (iii) development of a Climate Smart Agriculture IT Platform to collect all the relevant information such as soil type, hydrometeorological data, agriculture practices (i.e. use of fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, etc.), and guide the farmers toward resilient agriculture practices; and (iv) modernizing selected irrigation and drainage schemes for high-value agricultural production through support of innovative interventions to advance resilience, productivity, and sustainability of the agriculture sector. Component 2 will focus on addressing weak compliance and control mechanisms related to food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary standards which currently impede competitiveness and create market access inequalities both in the local and export markets. The project would provide support to increase institutional capacity to implement the food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary requirements through (i) establishment and upgrading of Border Inspection Posts to increase the competent authority capacity to perform official controls (documentary, identity and physical controls) for live animals, products of animal and non-animal origin, plants and plant products as well as agricultural inputs; (ii) improvement of diagnostic support in the areas of food safety, veterinary and plant health analyses; and (iii) development of storage capacity for detained goods which do not comply with food safety, veterinary or plant health standards. Component 3 will focus on establishing a sustainable and effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for agricultural and rural development policy in Albania. Support will be provided to build the monitoring capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and municipalities to increase their ability to measure and analyze agricultural policy impacts to support evidence-based policymaking, as well as to ensure capacity for project implementation and monitoring."

The proposed AF will primarily focus on addressing the short-term emergency needs but will also finance some medium-term investments to enhance food and nutrition security and build resilience. The grant funds will co-finance project activities planned under the various sub-components of the parent project as well as finance new project activities planned under a new sub-component. As such, the parent project design, component and sub-component structure and objectives will remain largely unchanged with the exception of Component 3 where an additional sub-component is proposed on the planned nutrition activities. The PDO of the parent project will be revised to reflect the nature of activities that are being financed especially as they relate to food insecurity and nutrition needs. The proposed (revised) PDO is to strengthen the foundations for a more resilient agricultural sector and support emergency interventions to address food and nutrition security in Tajikistan. Additional PDO level and IRIs indicators will be added to capture the new dimensions of the PDO and emergency interventions. Targets for parent project PDO indicators will be scaled up, while Intermediate Results Indicators (IRIs) will also be revised to reflect higher values for indicators linked to activities that will receive additional resources and to include new IRIs measuring new activities. The AF will follow the same geographic focus and selection criteria as the parent project. Beneficiaries will be expanded due to the increased resources and outreach, and also to include beneficiaries of the emergency seed and fertilizer distribution and nutrition-enhancing activities.The AF will cover the following additional activities: Component 1: Strengthening seed, seedling, and planting material systems. The objectives and sub-component structure of the component will remain the same. The SRASP AF will finance the following activities aiming to improve the enabling environment, and ensure the availability of improved, locally adapted, market oriented, farmer-preferred, and climate resilient seeds, seedlings, and planting materials for priority crops, in sufficient quantity and quality:Sub-component 1.1: Enabling environment, the the AF will increase the amount of funding allocated to this sub-component (co-financing), and the objective of the sub-component, which is improving the enabling environment of the seed, seedling, and planting materials system will be broadened to include food and nutrition security. The additional resources allocated to the sub-component will help the government to: (i) develop a FSCPP-to be financed from government own funding, (ii) review the existing Food Security Law #1591 (April 2019); and (iii) review the institutional arrangements for food and nutrition security The FSCPP will help in addressing the impacts of acute shocks, and the AF support will include preparing semi-annual reports for food security coordination bodies on risks, resilience, and immediate food security measures that need to be taken; and developing an M&E framework to provide timely and reliable information to facilitate informed decision-making on food security program management, as a part of an M&E system for implementation of the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) 2022-2030. The Food Security Law does not provide a clear structure for ensuring food security. Its revision is required especially with regard to the roles of the FSC and MOA to ensure coordination and harmonization of the efforts between stakeholders, including the private sector. Moreover, the current version of the Law is centered on self-sufficiency rather than food security. This definition of food security is not in line with the international understanding and the definition employed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The current law does not enable an efficient response for early warning and swift action to address emerging food security risks and prioritize increased resilience.Sub-component 1.2: No changeSub-component 1.3: Multiplication of seeds, seedlings, and planting materials, the SRASP AF will scale up the sub-component scope to include emergency procurement and distribution of improved seeds and fertilizers to farmers and vulnerable groups. The SRASP AF will support (co-finance) the procurement and distribution of seeds, fertilizers and small scale innovative farm machinery to vulnerable dehkan farmers and women, including to simplify women's manual labor; and provision of training for seed multiplication, seedlings and planting material and the use of small innovative equipment to vulnerable farmers. To improve the access to irrigation of dehkan farmers and women who will benefit from seeds, fertilizers, and small-scale innovative farm machinery, the SRASP AF will finance rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes through installation of energy efficient irrigation pumps and small works for rehabilitation of existing irrigation networks, including replacement of outdated non-performing pump units servicing existing irrigated land areas, as well as minor (emergency-type) rehabilitation of off-farm and on-farm irrigation infrastructure. The SRASP AF design will also look into supporting potential additional measures that may address the acute bottlenecks in food distribution and production systems, including targeting vulnerable households, returning migrants, and women..Sub-component 1.4: No change Component 2: Support investments in agri-logistical centers (ALCs) for horticulture value chains. The objectives and sub-component structure of the component will remain the same. The SRASP AF will allow the component to scale up activities of the parent project by supporting the establishment and operationalization of additional ALCs with the objective of building resilient food systems, promoting agricultural diversification, ensuring better market linkages, and improving competitiveness of horticulture value chains and access to markets.Sub-component 2.1: Support the establishment and operation of ALCs, the SRASP AF will support (co-finance) the establishment and operationalization of two additional ALCs in geographical locations to be identified following the same procedure and operation and management modality as in the parent project. The design feature (small in size) and services (cooling, storage, packing. Logistic facilities etc.) of the ALCs will also be the same as the parent project..Sub-component 2.2: No change Component 3: Strengthen public capacity for crises prevention and management. The objectives of the component and sub-components will remain the same, but there will be a new sub-component that will be included. The proposed SRASP AF-will allow the component to include additional activities that will further strengthen the capacity of the public sector to prevent and manage crises, and the new sub-component will help improve nutritional outcomes. Sub-component 3.1: Real-time monitoring of agricultural production, land use, and agrometeorology, AF will expand (co-finance) the scope of the sub-component which aims to enhance the early warning systems infrastructure, including: (i) developing an early warning system for livestock, including to prepare for hydro-meteorological and temperature extreme events and animal diseases; and strengthen national participation in regional and global early warning systems for hydro-meteorological events;(ii) improving market and agriculture inputs price information systems, including the scaling up of digital technologies and information platforms; Sub-component 3.2: No changeSub-component 3.3: No changeSub-component 3.4: Nutrition improvement (new sub-component) The SR"

With the support of the World Bank, the Somaliland and Puntland states piloted low cost and conflict deterring water solutions under the Water for Agro-Pastoralist Livelihoods Pilot Project (WALP), a US$2 million pilot that resulted in the building of eight sand dams over the period 2016 to 2018. This investment paved the way for the ongoing Water for Agro Pastoral Productivity and Resilience (Biyoole) Project. The increased budget (US$42 million) allowed to scale up activities across Puntland, Galmudug and South West States. The two projects validate the country’s approach to increasing water catchment in the drylands through sand dams which have the potential to protect water from high evapotranspiration whilst supplying in small amounts water for both domestic and agricultural consumption. The dams being small and not requiring extensive land masses to build pose less conflicts of which can be managed through both community level and high level conflict resolution mechanisms. The Biyoole project is building capacity in issues of policies, regulations and guidelines. Biyoole II, continues this trajectory by scaling up the investments and introducing environmental catchment services.The project will use an environmental catchment approach. The project will: increase access to domestic and productive water services, strengthen climate change adaptation and resilience, increase agricultural and livestock production and development through tailored extension services for water and environmental management and build the capacity of line institutions to provide basic services that address poverty and strengthen resilience. This project will: (a) improve access to water infrastructure among rural communities; (b) strengthen management of natural resources—e.g., water, land, forests, rangelands; (c) strengthen agricultural knowledge and innovation systems for livelihoods development. The project will deliver water harvesting and storage infrastructure and facilitate community action to help restore the quality of the land. It will leverage sand dam and other water-harvesting technology to enhance the adaptive capacity of Somalia’s dry lands and the livelihoods that depend on them. Through rigorous social mobilization processes, the project will help communities better understand how their decisions about management of land and water resources affect their well-being and how to become more climate-resilient. Communities will be aided to improve the quality of their land and water resources and to invest in the technology, training, and services necessary to improve crop production, pasture management and fodder production, animal health, and productivity. With improved organization and knowledge, communities can manage a more inclusive development agenda that increases the availability of water and food for all their member households and supports sustainable livelihoods that generate income for households that can be saved to help them better withstand inevitable future shocks.While the central and northern Somalia has water scarcity, the southern Somalia has both water management and water scarcity challenges. Government plans for future phases of the Biyoole to expand to include Jubaland and HirShabelle."

The objective of this component is to establish a system that would enable the GoD to mitigate risks related to food supply shocks in the future. From the planned activities, the project established a strategic food stock (equivalent to approximately one month of consumption) with its tools, including the creation of the Market Analysis Unit (MAU) at the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism (MCT) and the Stock Management Unit (SMU) at the Ministry of Social Affairs (MASS), both of which are operational. Due to a declaration by the Ministry of Agriculture regarding a severe drought currently affecting the inland regions, the Government proposes to increase (nearly double) the volume of the strategic stock and use part of this (about 20% of the stock) for food kit distribution to affected households. These activities will be funded by reallocating the US$5 million under the Food shortage preparedness fund. Component 2: Mitigating Food Security Risks Posed by Drought (US$5.0 million). The objective of this component is to mitigate the food security risks resulting from drought.

(a) New Subcomponent 5.1: Small infrastructure (US$10.80 million)which will finance the following: (i) Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes (US$1.64 million). The rehabilitation of three smallirrigation schemes that were badly damaged by the cyclones in Zambezia (US$1.62 million). The three schemes are located in thedistricts of Nicoadala and Maganja da Costa and total about 860 ha, which are all farmed by smallholders.(ii) Rehabilitation ofrural roads (US$4.75 million). This is the rehabilitation of selected market access rural roads which are key for producers andother actors to boost the development of value chains but which have been badly damaged by the cyclones. As already foreseen inSREP, the activities foreseen in the AF are localized interventions, specifically the rehabilitation of critical elementson selected rural roads and supervision of the execution of the referred works. This work will be led by FNDS in coordination withthe National Roads Administration (Administração Nacional de Estradas, ANE) on the basis of a memorandum of understanding alreadyin place.(iii) Construction/installation of boreholes and water tanks (US$4.41 million). To improve access to water supply indistricts in semiarid zones and districts with systems damaged by weather events, multipurpose boreholes will be built togetherwith water tanks and public fountains mainly for drinking and sanitation purposes but potentially also for limited (drip fororchards) irrigation use. The pre-molded cisterns are expected to have a capacity of 10,000 m³ and be capable of accumulating andconserving rainwater and be located mainly in the proximity of schools and health centers.New Subcomponent 5.2: Support to smallfarmers and livestock breeders (US$22 million). This subcomponent will finance the following: (i) Provision of agriculturalkits/seeds (US$15.09 million). The AF will provide agricultural input kits (available for free) to selected beneficiaries inemergency conditions in the selected 53 districts following the ‘fomento directo’ approach. The same rules which were adopted andregistered in the operations manual in MozNorte to support the farming communities in need will be used. No large pieces ofequipment (with the exception of small equipment, see point iii) will be provided, while it is expected to make wide use ofnutritious and drought-tolerant crops to increase households’ resilience to climate shocks.(ii) Provision of hermetic bags,installation of family silos (US$1.81 million). Most family farmers do not have a drying and storage structure for grains andbeans, having to pay a high price, or sell the produce and buy it later, to meet the family’s needs. The AF plans to make hermeticbags and small family silos available, in the form of a donation, to conserve the food reserve and reduce post-harvest losses.(iii) Provision of small equipment/tools (US$0.72 million). Most family farmers do not have proper tools to farm such as spades,groundnut rakes, hay pitchforks, and cutters, besides galoshes and gloves. The AF plans to make those available for free to allowmore effective use of farmers’ time, improve the quality of production, and reduce losses.(iv) Building of small livestockinfrastructure (US$2.94 million). Within the area affected by Tropical Storm Ana, several districts in four provinces (mainlyZambezia, Tete, Nampula, and Manica) are currently experiencing problems linked to livestock both in terms of lost units anddestroyed small livestock infrastructure and potential outbreak of diseases, which would need to be detected and cured on time (seebelow). A total of 527 installations (fences, hog houses, poultry houses, and so on) of small breeders were destroyed (plus severalthousand at the household level) and need to be rebuilt by using stronger materials and more resilient techniques.(v) Provision ofequipment for the veterinary lab in Tete (US$0.44 million). The lab is currently not functioning and hampers the possibility forsmall breeders to sell their product in the market and to the new abattoir. (vi) Provision of diagnostic consumables to theveterinary service in Nampula (US$0.16 million). The veterinary service in Nampula was weakened by the cyclones and does not havesufficient consumables to run diagnostics and handle potential outbreak of diseases. (vii) Establishment of a small ruminantscheme (US$0.84 million). The scheme will be implemented in four districts, which still need to be selected. The allocation ofgoats (four females and one male) and specific training to households aim to promote animal health, improve family income, andimprove food availability and nutrition outcomes. The animals will be delivered on a rotational basis to households to ensure thatthe greatest number of families in the communities are reached. The household that receives the first batch of five animals has theobligation to return two offspring to another family within one year. The delivery process of successive lambs will be accompaniedby the local District Service of Economic Activity (Serviços Distritais de Actividade Economica, SDAE) offices. The project mustensure that 50 percent of the animals distributed will be provided to families that currently have no ruminants.C- NewSubcomponent 5.3: Implementing a local approach to improve nutrition (US$2.90 million). This subcomponent will finance thefollowing:(i) Training in utilization of local products for enhanced nutrition security (US$1.19 million). This is a training oftrainers’ activity that is focused on educating households on what should be included in a balanced diet and uses the existinglocal agricultural produce. It will be implemented by SDAE extensionists and Community Health Workers or (Agentes PolivalenteElementar de Saude - APEs) and is aimed at teaching how farmers could produce, in the yard or on the plot, for example, producewhich would be healthy but is not easily available in the market (or available in markets that are too distant), and will alsoprovide advice on how forestry products and/or meat and/or fish could be integrated in farmers’ diet. The list of products couldalso include those that are mostly directed to export but have high nutrition content. A module on officinal plants and herbs willalso be developed and taught. (ii) Mobile nutrition kitchens (US$1.71 million). The experience of past and ongoing successfulprojects in several part of the world show that mobile kitchens are a means of communication capable of inducing behavioral change.In this case, it is proposed to support the activities of the 60 nutritionists already trained by the United Nations Children'sFund (UNICEF) (staff from the Ministry of Health, SETSAN, and INGC) and provide them with the means to travel in the"

The aim of this inventory is i) to establish an overall situation of national forest and rangelands resources, and ii) to provide reliable statistics and maps with more modern and less costly methods. The inventory will include: a national restoration/afforestation plan; deforestation maps, soil maps, and biodiversity inventories. CP1.2 Development of forest, pastoral, and fisheries management plans (US$5 million)Forest (US$2 million), rangeland (US$2 million), and fisheries (US$1 million) management plans are the main legal instruments guiding the management of these ecosystems. All forests, rangelands and fisheries areas in the targeted regions require new or updated management plans. These plans are key to ensuring the sustainable management and maintenance of these renewable resources. CP1.3: Climate informed territorial planning and development in targeted Communes (US$5 million)The preparation of communal development plans (PDC) in Niger is aligned with the communes’ Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES). The 2022 - 2027 PDES is still under finalization and will be published shortly. In this respect, the project will support the updating of the PDCs of the targeted communes, in particular to incorporate NDC commitments, climate change mitigation and adaptation planning and ensure the involvement of local stakeholders, mainly women, in the process.CP1.4: Enabling environment for Niger NDC and LDN implementation (US$2 million) This subcomponent will support (i) the improved functioning of the Niger CDN committee, and (ii) the updating and operationalizing of existing information management systems under the General Directorate of Water and Forests, as well as the development of a national MRV system to ensure the monitoring of the Niger NDC and LDN as part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. .COMPONENT 2: Investments in Landscape Restoration and Community Resilience to Climate Change (US$115 million)Sub-component 2.1: Restoring Landscapes and Ecosystem Services (US$70 million)Targeted investments will include measures aimed at improving carbon pools, preventing soil degradation, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, increasing carbon stock, and restoring lands, favoring biodiversity conservation and biodynamic agriculture (with high potential for mitigation co-benefits). Drought-resistant products will be developed and specific techniques (such as ‘no tillage’ techniques) will reduce water evaporation adaptation co-benefits. Through this subcomponent, the project is seeking to restore 205,000 ha and 11,000 km of hedge and pastoral corridors, through techniques that have been identified in the NDC. The selection of restoration sites will be based on criteria that include, among others, land tenure status, community commitment for sustainable management, whether the site meets technical requirements, vulnerability to climate risks, and the potential to increase carbon sinks.Sub-component 2.2: Improving Local Livelihoods Resilience (US$45 million)This subcomponent aims to enable local producers, especially youths and women, to improve their livelihoods by becoming more competitive producers capable of meeting market demands while improving their resilience to climate change. Activities will focus on three interrelated areas: (i) valorizing and promoting the sustainable development of NTFPs; (ii) the improvement and development of artisanal fisheries products; (iii) promoting the preservation of the cultural and non-tangible capital of local communities; and (iv) establishing and implementing integrated community agro-silvo-pastoral farms (FACIs) as innovative models of economic development and food security.CP2.2.1. Sustainable development of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) (US$20 million)NTFPs provide women and their families with means of subsistence, additional services, and jobs. In this component, activities to enhance women’s cultural heritage and artisanal skills in harvesting and handling products [Baobab (Adansonia digitata), Honey, Doum palm (Hyphaene thebaica), Balanites (Balanites aegyptiaca), the Boscia fruit (Boscia Senegalensis), Marula (Sclerocarya birrea), and Nere (Parkia biglobosa)] will be supported (see Table 5). The value addition to these products will increase women’s income by generating more profits from yield and commercialization. These activities are designed to support women’s entrepreneurship and economic and social empowerment. Supporting the linkages of producer groups to NGOs and off-taker organizations will ensure these small businesses can be sustained beyond the life cycle of the project.CP2.2.2 Fisheries products (US$15 million). The project will support traditional fishing from water reservoirs and community ponds and address the main constraints faced by the sector, which include: (a) inadequate fishing infrastructures (small landing sites) and water bodies, (b) fry production, (c) fish feed production, and (d) fish products transport. Project support will be provided through the normative principles of productive alliances to strengthen collaboration between the public and the private sector and facilitate the access of associated artisanal fishermen to markets. The activity will strengthen the participation of women in the fishing sub-sector, where they are responsible for activities downstream of fishing, such as fish processing, trading etc., all essential for the profitability of this activity. CP2.2.3 Intangible capital (US$3 million). This subcomponent will promote the cultural and non-tangible capital of local communities, and finance initiatives that celebrate and amplify traditional and customary practices related to natural resources. These practices are an essential part of the Sahelian identity and are key to preserving the long history of interaction between the cultural and natural environments. The project will finance activities such as the production of handicrafts, festivals and events. In addition, traditional and customary practices in natural resources management will be prioritized in the techniques promoted by the project for land restoration, fishing, and farming. This sub-component will be implemented by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Handicrafts.CP2.2.4: Community Integrated Agro-Silvo-Pastoral Farms (FACI) (US$7 million). Integrated community agro-silvo-pastoral farms (FACIs) are innovative models of economic development in the regions of the GGW and have been deployed s"

Like its predecessor, PRAPS-2 has been developed around five technical components, with the addition of focal areas that are essential to holistically address some of the core drivers of resilience among (agro)pastoral populations. The proposed activities will be implemented over a six-year period. Each component will include complementary activities at the national and regional level, conforming to the principle of subsidiarity of interventions between regional and national levels. Institutional capacity building will be supported across components and activities to create an enabling environment to govern the sector in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner.PRAPS-2 interventions will have regional spillover impact. Sahelian (agro)pastoral systems rely on natural resources extending across national boundaries to accommodate climate variability and the seasonality of resources, and they also rely on regional market outlets (mainly in coastal countries) to move livestock and livestock products. At the same time, this activity increases vulnerability to contagious livestock diseases (also termed “transboundary” diseases). PRAPS-2 combines investments at the national level with coordination and support from regional institutions to generate benefits extending beyond the individual countries participating in the Project (regional public goods). These benefits include a reduction in animal health risks in countries that are transit areas or destinations for livestock (which helps to protect livestock capital throughout the region), a reduction in competition for natural resources (which reduces the risks of land degradation and conflict), and improved trade facilitation (which leads to greater economic gains), and overall greater regional stability. PRAPS-2 will play a major role in forging essential cross-sectoral and cross-border collaboration, and it will ensure synergies and complementarities—spatial and thematic—between Project investments and other ongoing and planned interventions.PRAPS-2 will prioritize geographic areas based on three principles: (i) consolidating PRAPS-1 achievements in implementing natural resource and infrastructure governance mechanisms; (ii) reinforcing spatial coherence and clustering along key livestock mobility routes to increase synergies among interventions and avoid the dispersion of investments; and (iii) supporting cross-border cooperation and dialogue in the Sahel Region to tackle cross-border transhumance, regional trade, and planning along selected strategic livestock trade routes. Some interventions will be implemented nationwide, including those related to animal health, social inclusion, and institutional capacity building. The interventions in Niger and Mauritania to be supported through the proposed additional financing (AF) will complement other WB projects and partners interventions to respond to the food insecurity crisis, by providing short to medium term support to boost recovery and resilience of (agro)pastoral populations. The AF will scale up activities foreseen under component 2 and subcomponent 4.3 of the parent project, and add new activities under subcomponent 5.2. Details are provided in the project paper.PRAPS-II is built around the following: components.Component 1: Animal health improvement and veterinary medicine control The main outcome of this component will be increased capacity in Veterinary Services t o protect large and small ruminants from small ruminant plague (PPR) and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), two transboundary animal diseases that cause major losses throughout the region. The proposed Project will pursue investments initiated under PRAPS-1 to establish more robust animal health systems in beneficiary countries (Subcomponent 1.1), finance vaccination and surveillance campaigns primarily targeting PPR and CBPP (Subcomponent 1.2), and support quality control of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) (Subcomponent 1.3). Recognizing the highly contagious nature of PPR and CBPP and the public health threats of misusing VMPs and increasing antimicrobial resistance, this component will be implemented throughout t he beneficiary countries, with critical infrastructure (veterinary posts, vaccination pens) being upgraded primarily in underserved pastoral areas. Component 2: Sustainable landscape management and governance enhancement The main outcomes of Component 2 will be an increased area under sustainable landscape management and stronger governance of pastoral lands and livestock mobility, in compliance with agro-silvo-pastoral laws. Building on the legacy of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will further secure mobility and enhance access to natural resources (Subcomponent 2.1); finance the construction, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of essential water infrastructure (Subcomponent 2.2); and support fodder production (Subcomponent 3.3). These activities will enhance the resilience of (agro)pastoralists to climate risks and—by improving grazing management and livestock productivity—will improve soil carbon sequestration and reduce livestock emission intensities to mitigate climate change and provide additional ecosystem services. To the extent possible, Project investments will be directed at well-targeted transhumance routes and key livestock mobility corridors at the local, national, and cross-border level, to ensure the geographic concentration of activities and enable dialogue between adjacent cross-border communities in support of peaceful transhumance and resource use. Component 3: Livestock value chain improvement The outcome of Component 3 will be improved pastoral livestock value chains (VCs), the facilitation of regional livestock trade, and better regional market integration. Building on the achievements of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will continue to fill gaps in strategic market infrastructure along regional trade routes (Subcomponent 3.1), strengthen the capacities of national and regional producers' organizations (Subcomponent 3.2), and support innovative solutions for developing livestock VCs through subproject financing (Subcomponent 3.3). Activities under Subcomponents 3.1 and 3.3 will be prioritized along key regional trade routes where animals convoyed by foot move across borders to supply growing demand from markets in coastal countries.Component 4: Social and economic inclusion improvement, women and youth The outcome of Component 4 will be increased resilience as a result of expanding the socio-economic inclusion of (agro)pastoralists, particularly women and youth. PRAPS-1 successfully supported inclusion by improving access to skills training and technical and vocational training, and through direct support for the development of income-generating activities (IGAs). The proposed Project will provide continuity for these interventions by expanding access to technical and vocational training (Subcomponent 4.1) and IGAs (Subcomponent 4.3), focusing on a more structured approach for targeting young people and women. PRAPS-2 will also open a new area of work to promote the inclusion of pastoral populations in social and civil registries (Subcomponent 4.2). Component 5: Project coordination, institutional strengthening, crisis prevention and response Component 5 will focus on all aspects of Project management, including fiduciary management, safeguards, monitoring and evaluation, and communication (under Subcomponent 5.1). It will also support the development of institutional capacity (through adapted training as well as pastoral crisis prevention tools and procedures) and fill important knowledge and data gaps at the national and regional level (Subcomponent 5.2). The Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) will allow countries to respond swiftly to eligible crises or emergencies (Subcomponent 5.3)."

Like its predecessor, PRAPS-2 has been developed around five technical components, with the addition of focal areas that are essential to holistically address some of the core drivers of resilience among (agro)pastoral populations (see the Project Results Chain in Section D and Detailed Component Description in Annex 2). The proposed activities will be implemented over a six-year period. Each component will include complementary activities at the national and regional level, conforming to the principle of subsidiarity of interventions between regional and national levels. Institutional capacity building will be supported across components and activities to create an enabling environment to govern the sector in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner.Regional spillover impact of PRAPS-2 interventions. Sahelian (agro)pastoral systems rely on natural resources extending across national boundaries to accommodate climate variability and the seasonality of resources, and they also rely on regional market outlets (mainly in coastal countries) to move livestock and livestock products. At the same time, this activity increases vulnerability to contagious livestock diseases (also termed “transboundary” diseases). PRAPS-2 combines investments at the national level with coordination and support from regional institutions to generate benefits extending beyond the individual countries participating in the Project (regional public goods). These benefits include a reduction in animal health risks in countries that are transit areas or destinations for livestock (which helps to protect livestock capital throughout the region), a reduction in competition for natural resources (which reduces the risks of land degradation and conflict), and improved trade facilitation (which leads to greater economic gains), and overall greater regional stability. The proposed Project will play a major role in forging essential cross-sectoral and cross-border collaboration, and it will ensure synergies and complementarities—spatial and thematic—between Project investments and other ongoing and planned interventions.PRAPS-2 will prioritize geographic areas based on three principles. They are: (i) consolidating PRAPS-1 achievements in implementing natural resource and infrastructure governance mechanisms; (ii) reinforcing spatial coherence and clustering along key livestock mobility routes to increase synergies among interventions and avoid the dispersion of investments; and (iii) supporting cross-border cooperation and dialogue in the Sahel Region to tackle cross-border transhumance, regional trade, and planning along selected strategic livestock trade routes. Some interventions will be implemented nationwide, including those related to animal health, social inclusion, and institutional capacity building. Component 1: Animal health improvement and veterinary medicine control (US$125.3 million). The main outcome of this component will be increased capacity in VS to protect large and small ruminants from small ruminant plague (PPR) and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), two transboundary animal diseases that cause major losses throughout the region. The proposed Project will pursue investments initiated under PRAPS-1 to establish more robust animal health systems in beneficiary countries (Subcomponent 1.1), finance vaccination and surveillance campaigns primarily targeting PPR and CBPP (Subcomponent 1.2), and support quality control of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) (Subcomponent 1.3). Recognizing the highly contagious nature of PPR and CBPP and the public health threats of misusing VMPs and increasing antimicrobial resistance, this component will be implemented throughout the beneficiary countries, with critical infrastructure (veterinary posts, vaccination pens) being upgraded primarily in underserved pastoral areas. Component 2: Sustainable landscape management and governance enhancement (US$ 72.3 million)The main outcomes of Component 2 will be an increased area under sustainable landscape management and stronger governance of pastoral lands and livestock mobility, in compliance with agro-silvo-pastoral laws. Building on the legacy of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will further secure mobility and enhance access to natural resources (Subcomponent 2.1); finance the construction, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of essential water infrastructure (Subcomponent 2.2); and support fodder production (Subcomponent 3.3). These activities will enhance the resilience of pastoralists to climate risks and—by improving grazing management and livestock productivity—will improve soil carbon sequestration and reduce livestock emission intensities to mitigate climate change and provide additional ecosystem services. To the extent possible, Project investments will be directed at well-targeted transhumance routes and key livestock mobility corridors at the local, national, and cross-border level, to ensure the geographic concentration of activities and enable dialogue between adjacent cross-border communities in support of peaceful transhumance and resource use. Component 3: Livestock value chain improvement (US$ 59.4 million)The outcome of Component 3 will be improved pastoral livestock value chains (VCs), the facilitation of regional livestock trade, and better regional market integration. Building on the achievements of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will continue to fill gaps in strategic market infrastructure along regional trade routes (Subcomponent 3.1), strengthen the capacities of national and regional producers' organizations (Subcomponent 3.2), and support innovative solutions for developing livestock VCs through subproject financing (Subcomponent 3.3). Activities under Subcomponents 3.1 and 3.3 will be prioritized along key regional trade routes where animals convoyed by foot move across borders to supply growing demand from markets in coastal countries.Component 4: Social and economic inclusion improvement, women and youth improvement (US$ 47.1 million)The outcome of Component 4 will be increased resilience as a result of expanding the socio-economic inclusion of pastoralists, particularly women and youth. PRAPS-1 successfully supported inclusion by improving access to skills training and technical and vocational training, and through direct support for the development of income-generating activities (IGAs). The proposed Project will provide continuity for these interventions by expanding access to technical and vocational training (Subcomponent 4.1) and IGAs (Subcomponent 4.3), focusing on a more structured approach for targeting young people and women. PRAPS-2 will also open a new area of work to promote the inclusion of pastoral populations in social and civil registries (Subcomponent 4.2). Component 5: Project coordination, institutional strengthening, and emergency prevention and response (US$ 73.3 million)Component 5 will focus on all aspects of Project management, including fiduciary management, safeguards, monitoring and evaluation, and communication (under Subcomponent 5.1). It will also support the development of institutional capacity (through adapted training as well as pastoral crisis prevention tools and procedures) and fill important knowledge and data gaps at the national and regional level (Subcomponent 5.2). The Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) will allow countries to respond swiftly to eligible crises or emergencies (Subcomponent 5.3)."

The Program development objectives (PDOs) are to (i) strengthen fiscal management; (ii) improve natural resources management and raise mining and livestock productivity; and (iii) improve health service delivery and social spending efficiency. In the context of a fragile and poor country facing hard security, humanitarian and, most recently, COVID-19 shocks, the program supported by the DPF series has preserved modest but steady progress on structural reforms, while contributing to the response to the COVID-19 crisis. The series selectively addresses three binding constraints to growth of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF): scarce public resources, low agricultural and mining productivity, and inefficient health and social service delivery. These three critical areas of reform are supported by a solid macroeconomic framework and a public sector capable of creating fiscal and delivering social services to the extent of its possibilities. By creating fiscal space, providing key tools to redeploy health professionals, improving control of the distribution of medicines in COVID-19-affected areas, and setting the basis for a proper registration mechanism of indigents, including those testing positive to the virus and eligible IDPs, this DPF complements an emergency COVID-19 response investment project financing (IPF) supporting the Government’s efforts aiming to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19, while strengthening national systems for public health preparedness."

This operation, in the amount of US$120 million, including US$80 million from the IDA 18 Crisis Response Window, is the first of three Development Policy Financing (DPF) operations in a programmatic series. The program development objective of the DPF is to support the Government of Mongolia in restoring debt sustainability, strengthening the social protection system, and enhancing competitiveness. The economic boom in 2011‐13, fueled by strong mineral exports and foreign direct investment (FDI), and expansionary fiscal policy, left Mongolia highly vulnerable to external shocks. These risks materialized from 2014 onward. With minerals accounting for almost 90 percent of exports, a sharp drop in commodity prices and slower growth in China significantly weakened the external and fiscal positions. The economy also took a major hit from a collapse of foreign investment which had reached over 30 percent of GDP during boom years. Expansionary policies compounded these shocks. Economic policy turned expansionary during the double‐digit growth period despite high inflation and a sharp widening of the current account deficit. Economic policy was loosened further from 2014 in response to the external shocks through fiscal expansion and monetary easing, driven by off‐budget expenditure and quasi‐fiscal lending. The economic stimulus, however, came at the cost of a significant increase in economic vulnerabilities. Government debt has increased almost fourfold since 2011, with the budget deficit reaching 17 percent of GDP in 2016. Mounting pressure on the balance of payments caused a sharp currency depreciation and a significant loss of reserves since 2013. Substantial risks to the balance of payments remain as about US$660 million sovereign bonds mature in 2018. The DPF, along with operations from other development partners, supports a set of reform measures to stabilize Mongolia’s economy and move it towards a sustainable development path. The reform programs supported by the DPF, developed in close collaboration with the IMF and ADB, seek to: (i) restore debt sustainability; (ii) strengthening the social protection system; and (iii) enhancing competitiveness. The DPF will also help Mongolia mitigate the immediate balance of payments risks by catalyzing successful market‐based refinancing of maturing commercial debt, and create fiscal space by substituting high‐cost, short‐term domestic borrowing with relatively more concessional and long maturity external assistance."

The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices will increase small-holder farmer crop yield, farmer income and welfare, reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation, which would be supported inthe short term by carbon revenues received from a significant increase in bio-carbon sequestration in agricultural areas and avoided emissions in forested areas. 

 To protect and expand areas under natural forest and conserve biodiversity through the intensification of food production on existing farm plots by adoption of legume-based agroforestry with in-built firewood production and avoidance of fallows, which will replace the need for further forest clearing as part of slash and burn agriculture, firewood and charcoal production. The decisions on land delineation for specific management purposes rest with the chiefs in consultation with the communities. Currently the challenge is one where allocation of forest areas for agricultural purposes to communities is made by the chief, and as a result the forested areas within the chiefdom are shrinking over time. Several chiefdoms have recognized the problemand are willing to set aside forest areas within chiefdoms for conservation use known as community conservation areas (CCAs). The interventions in CCAs will include land use planning, and preparation forest management plans by communities for managing conservation areas through implementing practices that will ensure that the forest areas are sustained.

This operation will support reforms to strengthen public financial management and improve social services delivery. Given the importance of the public sector to Tuvalu's economy, an effective system for public financial management (PFM) is critical. The first pillar of the program focuses on strengthening PFM with the specific development objectives of improved commitment control, enhanced oversight of fishing revenue, and streamlined reporting of local governments (Kapaules). The second pillar focuses on improved service delivery with the specific objectives of enhancing the management and efficiency of Tuvalu's essential, but costly, overseas medical treatment scheme and strengthening vocational training, including increased access for women. These services are essential to building and maintaining human capital, a key asset for an undiversified small economy. Together, the supported reforms are designed to help Tuvalu improve its fiscal position both in terms of revenue and expenditure, while maintaining the quality of public services."
