ETG is raising up to USD 550 million to finance its core value chain under the two tranches –Development Finance Institutions (“DFI”) term tranche and commercial revolving credit facility.  ETG is currently reaching 4 million smallholder farmers active in 48 countries worldwide, trading in excess of 80 commodities. The Group is purchasing crops from farmers as close to farmgate as feasible, aggregating and transporting to port warehouses and selling cargo to end-buyer across the world, after processing and value addition. At the same time, ETG purchases and imports fertilizers and agro-inputs from across the world for distribution to dealers and farmers in Africa. The Group’s value chain backed up by its own hub-and-spoke logistics network requires funding to be renewed every season, permanent in nature. The Bank’s financing will be deployed to ETG’s core value chains in Africa (including Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia) to support the processing and packaging facilities, warehouses and depots and provide fertilizers and agri-inputs under the DFI term tranche. There is a possibility that the Bank’s financing will be deployed beyond the countries abovementioned up to 28 countries in Africa based on the emerging needs. The project contributes to climate finance, with 37.5 million USD of the total approved amount dedicated to mitigation.","The main development outcomes stem from: (i) contribution to food security by increasing agricultural production and enhancing logistical capacity to strengthen distribution mechanisms; (ii) contribution to food import substitution by processing and packaging agricultural products locally while increasing value addition of export-oriented products, which decrease the current account deficit in African countries (iii) job creation for men, youth and women throughout various agriculture commodity value-chains;(iv) fiscal contribution to RMCs through import/export duties, corporate tax, value-added tax; and (v) explicit support for women enterprises to enhance their business management skills and promote inclusive growth in the agriculture and food sectors where a large number of women can be employed.","Based on the sustainability KPIs and annual targets, it is expected that 600,000 supply chain farmers (1 million by 2032) would receive extension services by 2027, 25% will be women farmers by 2027 (50% by 2030).

The proposed Bank emergency assistance is to contribute to the alleviation of the suffering of the victims of the desert locust in these regions. Indeed, the East and Horn of Africa, which is one of the most fragile regions of the continent, is being ravaged by large locust swarms coming from the Arabian Peninsula. The desert locust infestation occurring in the region poses an unprecedented risk to livelihoods and food security in an already fragile region in that it causes huge damages on agricultural production. Studies have shown that a swarm of one square kilometer can devour the equivalent of crops that could feed 35,000 people for a year (FAO). The situation is particularly alarming in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia where widespread breeding is ongoing and new swarms are expected to form in the coming weeks. The emergency relief assistance operation will be funded through a grant from the Bank’s SRF. The total grant amount is for one million five hundred thousand US dollars (USD 1,500,000). The immediate priority should be to first control the spread of the current invasion and eliminate the current threat, therefore the grant funds will specifically contribute to the regional desert locust invasion control effort, prevention of next generation swarms and impact assessment and monitoring for enhanced preparedness and awareness creation.",The objective of the Bank emergency assistance is to respond to the request from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) which was mandated by the IGAD Heads of State and Government Summit in February 2020 to mobilize resources on behalf of the member states and streamline the assistance to affected countries in the East and Horn of Africa.,"The operation will target vulnerable individuals and households with the primary objective of saving lives and preserving livelihoods in the nine (09) countries affected (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania).",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-Z1-A00-030,"['breeding', 'feed']",[],[],"['breeding', 'feed']"

It will directly contribute in developing Sudan’s livestock value chain (poultry and beef) by increasing the country’s export capacity for value-added livestock products. This will help reduce the economic value that the country loses by exporting millions of live animals each year. This facility to Elnefeidi Group is another demonstration of the African Development Bank’s continued support and strong commitment to enable, deepen, and empower the private sector in Sudan, as an engine of economic and inclusive growth. This is also consistent with Sudan’s National Agriculture Investment Plan, which seeks to achieve agriculture-linked growth, largely through private investments.","Elnefeidi will use the funds to enhance its agricultural productivity and improve its food processing, infrastructure and distribution capabilities. The loan is expected to contribute significantly to food security, food import substitution, and household incomes by creating jobs. It will also in turn increase local productivity and distribution by over half a million metric tonnes each year across several countries.","The main project beneficiairies are Elnefeidi Group Holding Co.

In fact, in 2004, Niger experienced a drop and a considerable irregularity of rainfall that affected crops in the agro-pastoral belt. This was coupled with a severe locust infestation and the country thus recorded a forage deficit of 4.6 million tonnes, or 37% of requirements, and an estimated cereal deficit of 223,350 tonnes, or about 7.5 % of needs estimated at 2,992,600 tons inducing a severe food crisis. As part of this operation, the Government plans :(i) the establishment of approximately 67 000 tonnes of basic cereals until August 2005; (ii) the development of crisis mitigation micro-projects for the establishment of: (1) 1000 grain banks totaling 10,000 tons of food; (2) 8,100 tonnes of food for work and 540 million FCFA for cash for work; (iii) the distribution of 15,000 tons of zootechnical inputs (cottonseed, wheat bran) in order to support the farmers in the maintenance of their animals; (iv) the distribution of emergency cereal seeds in order to help farmers better prepare the 2005 crop year. The intervention of the African Development Bank should be used for the purchase of basic necessities.","The food aid envisaged under this operation aims at the rapid supply of food and the nutritional rehabilitation of the populations victims of the drought and the desert locust in the affected areas.

Through its farming systems research and its extension network , the project will identify constraints and need within the sector, and introduce improved farming practices. The project will have a national scope. In view however of the higher concentration of cattle in the southern Provinces of Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane, the principal activities for cattle will be carried out in these Provinces, initially focusing on 10 priority districts which have been identified by the Government. Intervention will commence in those Districts which are currently safe, spreading later to other Districts as the security situation improves. The project will also assist the regeneration and improvement of small ruminants in those areas where these species have been traditionally kept, and cattle are absent because of animal trypanosomiasis, and will revive backyard poultry production in the northern Provinces, which in stable times are grain surplus areas. The shortage of adequately trained manpower and institutional strengthening will be addressed through the provision of technical assistance and training support. The project will have a duration of five years.","The overall objective of the project is, in the medium-term, to stabilize the national livestock population, and rehabilitate livestock infrastructure which have been decimated by civil disturbances and drought in recent years; and to introduce measures which in the long-term will lead to the improvement of animal production, to the increase in livestock numbers up to a level commensurate with the land’s carrying capacity, and to the increased supply of animal protein and draught power within the family farming sector.","At full development, an estimated 150,000 families are expected to benefit from the project.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-MZ-AA0-008,"['animal health', 'cattle', 'livestock', 'poultry']",['livestock'],[],"['animal health', 'cattle', 'livestock', 'poultry']"

P-CI-AAF-001,https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-CI-AAF-001,"La lagune Aby, d'une superficie de 424 km2 est située à l'extrême Sud-Est de la Côte d'Ivoire. La lagune communique avec l'océan par une série de chenaux se réunissant en une passe unique au niveau du village d'Assinie-Mafia. La population autour de la lagune est de 46.000 personnes (40 villages). L'activité de base est la pêche même si chaque famille pratique des cultures vivrières de subsistance. Les femmes s'occupent du fumage du poisson (1.580 fumeuses). La pêche comprend deux secteurs bien distincts selon les engins utilisés: la pêche collective (1.200 pêcheurs) utilisant des sennes Aly et des sennes tournantes, la pêche individuelle (800 pêcheurs) avec des filets maillant à une nappe, des guideaux à crevettes, des éperviers et des nappes en fibres végétales. Les ressources halieutiques comprennent 3 groupes de poissons (Ethlamose, Cichlidae, Chrysichthys) et 3 crustacés exploitables. La surexploitation des ressources provoque une baisse des prises et une baisse concomitante du revenu des pêcheurs.","La population cible du projet est composée des 46.000 habitants de l'ensemble des villages existants autour de la lagune dont 2.000 pêcheurs et 1.580 fumeuses.

Objectifs et composantes du projet

Les objectifs principaux du projet sont l'amélioration des conditions de vie et des revenus des pêcheurs et des fumeuses par le biais d'une exploitation rationnelle des ressources de la lagune Aby et de l'utilisation d'un matériel de pêche approprié.

Les composantes du projet sont les suivantes:

Vulgarisation, encadrement et gestion: encadrement des pêcheurs et encouragement du recours à des techniques adéquates de pêche, expérimentations et démonstrations d'aquaculture et de fumage, formation, soutien des groupements de pêcheurs et aide pour leurs demandes de crédit.
Assistance directe à la pêche et au fumage: un volet investissements directs comprenait l'installation d'une chambre froide, un four amélioré, des enclos d'aquaculture et des acadjas. Un système de crédit réalisé en étroite collaboration avec la BNDA devait financer la pêche, le fumage, la commercialisation de poisson frais et l'aquaculture.
Infrastructures socio-économiques: construction de 11 débarcadères, de 40 puits (20 nouveaux, 20 à réhabiliter), de 3 marchés ruraux et d'un centre de services pour la réparation, l'entretien et la maintenance des moteurs d'embarcations.
Formation, suivi et évaluation: le suivi devait être assuré par la Direction des Pêches et 3 évaluations de 2 mois devaient être effectuées. Deux expertises devaient être réalisées: étude des disponibilités en bois, une expertise en comptabilité.","Composante infrastructures socio-économiques: 29 débarquadères, au lieu des 11 prévus, ont été construits à cause de la pression exercée par les populations riveraines et les responsables politiques locaux (moyen de désenclaver les villages situés autour de la lagune). 28 puits ont été réalisés. Au lieu d'un centre de services, le projet a ouvert un magasin de vente de pièces détachées qui n'a fonctionné qu'en 1987, les pêcheurs préférant s'approvisionner directement sur les marchés ghanéens ou sur le marché de Dabou à des prix nettement moins élevés. 3 marchés couverts ont été réalisés mais ne sont pas utilisés par les commerçants (prix d'acquisition des stands trop élevés). Un local administratif et 2 logements ont aussi été construits.

Composante encadrement administratif: l'encadrement des pêcheurs a consisté en la mise en place de 4 conseillers de pêche (au lieu de 6 prévus), l'organisation de réunions d'information, la visite systématique des pêcheurs dans leur village, des déplacements ponctuels en cas de conflits particuliers. Le projet a aidé à la constitution de 8 GVC et de plusieurs groupes informels devant constituer à terme de nouveaux GVC. La vulgarisation de nouvelles techniques de fumage s'est effectuée sous forme de démonstrations (24 séances). Des comités d'hygiène villageois ont été constitués et ont permis une diminution notable des maladies diarrhéiques au sein de la population cible.

Assistance directe à la pêche et au fumage: 8 crédits pêche ont été octroyés à des GVC pour un montant total de 19.231.930 FCFA (financement des armements de pêche artisanale lagunaire), 1 prêt à un GVC de fumeuses qui n'a pas été remboursé, aucun prêt pour la mise en place de chaines de froid ou pour l'aquaculture. Au total, le montant déboursé par la BNDA s'élève en juillet 1988 à 17,43 millions de FCFA soit 3,9% du montant prévu. Comme investissements directs, ont été construits, 4 fours de démonstration (type ""Adiaké"" et ""Chorkor""), une fabrique de glace. Deux types d'expérimentation d'acadjas ont été menés (acadja traditionnel et acadja en bambou non enclos). Le projet a construit un catamaran et 6 pirogues (non prévus) qui se sont révélés inadaptés par absence de flottabilité et n'ont pu être exploités.

Formation: ce volet n'a pas eu l'ampleur prévue (203 jours de formation sur 604 prévus).

Le suivi et l'évaluation: aucune unité n'a été mise en place.

En 1987, un certain nombre de mesures ayant pour but de rationnaliser l'effort de pêche et de préserver la resource renouvelables ont été prises: interdiction des sennes tournantes, mise en place d'un système de licences de pêche, fermeture de la pêche pendant 6 mois de l'année.

Appréciation des effets du projet et de leur perennité

Effets sur les revenus des bénéficiaires: les pêcheurs individuels utilisant les filets maillants parviennent actuellement à améliorer les niveaux de revenus observés en 1982 (290.000 FCFA de revenu annuel actuellement et 188.000 en 1982). La rentabilité des sennes de plage est insuffisante. Les revenus des fumeuses marquent une croissance de 107% par rapport à 1982.

Impact sur les conditions de vie: les débarcadères ont permis de désenclaver certains villages; les puits ont réduit fortement le nombre de maladies diarrhéiques.

Effets sur les revenus et les conditions de vie des femmes:la présence des puits permet d'alléger la pénibilité de l'approvisionnement en eau qui pèse essentiellement sur les femmes et les enfants. Les revenus des fumeuses ont augmentés (voir para 15).

Impact sur l'emploi: l'adoption de mesures destinées à supprimer l'usage des sennes tournantes et à enrayer la chute du niveau de production a eu un impact défavorable sur l'emploi (beaucoup de pêcheurs étrangers sont retournés dans leur pays). En revanche, les actions d'assistance aux GVC ont permis à 107 menbres de GVC de développer leur activité dans la zone du projet et de s'y stabiliser.

Effets sur l'environnement et sur la base de ressource:depuis 1985, on observe une diminution de la production et des rendements ce qui confirme la tendance antérieure de baisse des stocks que le projet n'a pas réussi à renverser. Chaque amélioration des rendements observés après chaque période de fermeture reste fragile et de moins en moins importante d'une période de fermeture à l'autre.

L'existence du projet a permis de renforcer les capacités techniques et humaines de la direction des pêches, d'intaurer une étroite collaboration entre les differents acteurs concernés par les problèmes de pêche sur la lagune Aby, de renforcer les institutions traditionnelles (chefs de village et administratives (chefs de canton) dans leur role d'arbitre des conflits et de participants aux prises de décision (fermeture de la pêche, instauration d'un système de licences.

Principaux problèmes rencontrés

L'incapacité du projet à enrayer la baisse des stocks

La baisse des stocks concerne l'ensemble des espèces (pas seulement l'Ethlamose). On peut distinguer deux facteurs:

des conditions défavorables: des facteurs hydrologiques négatifs (faibles apports) et un ensablement des chenaux de la passe d'Assinie.
une surexploitation liée à une augmentation de la puissance de pêche. La quasi totalité des sennes de plage de grande longueur et de chute importante sont encore en activité et le nombre de filets syndicats a tendance à augmenter ainsi que le nombre d'engins individuels (filets maillants grande maille et éperviers).
Les efforts entrepris par le projet pour limiter la pression sur les stocks disponibles (interdiction des sennes tournantes, licences, fermeture saisonnière de la pêche) vont dans le bon sens mais ne sont pas suffisants. Quelques erreurs ont cependant été commises: 73% des crédits accordés l'ont été pour l'achat de 4 grands filets dont l'effet destructeur sur les stocks d'Ethlamose et de Machoirons n'est plus à démontrer.

Des insuffisances dans l'administration du projet

Exception faite des procès verbaux des réunions du conseil d'organisation et de suivi,aucun rapport d'activité n'est publié. La mission n'a pu disposer d'aucun document décrivant les activités du projet ou établissant un bilan des réalisations physiques et financières. La gestion comptable laisse également à désirer puisqu'un seul journal comptable est tenu et qu'aucun autre état financier n'est élaboré. Enfin, les coûts de fonctionnement notamment au niveau du poste carburant du parc de véhicules se sont révélés parfois excessifs.

Recommandations et leçons à tirer

Les propositions en matière d'aménagement de la pêche visent à maitriser l'effort de pêche, en veillant à privilégier les mesures dont la mise en oeuvre s'avère la plus aisée. La fermeture annuelle de la saison de pêche constitue une mesure indispensable à la reconstitution des stocks. Sa durée doit être fonction de l'effort de pêche entrepris et surtout de l'évolution de la situation de la lagune. Le suivi des captures et de la biologie des espèces sera déterminant. Le système des licences doit être maintenu et leur nombre limité. Il doit être accompagné de l'enregistrement de tous les engins de pêche et de la création d'une brigade de surveillance. L'expérimentation d'une senne de plage rénovée et de taille limitée est opportune en raison de l'absence de sélectivité des sennes utilisées actuellement. Les efforts de pêche devraient porter sur les stocks actuellement sous-exploités; une action de développement de la pêche au crabe pourrait bénéficier à une centaine de pêcheurs.

Le projet devrait intensifier ses efforts pour le développement des acadjas (3 ha en 1989 et 5 ha l'année suivante si les résultats sont positifs).

Les démonstrations des nouveaux fours se tiendront dans 20 villages. Une campagne de promotion de l'utilisation de la glace devrait être lancée.

En ce qui concerne la chambre froide que le GVC d'Assinie se propose de construire, une étude préalable sur la pêche et la commercialisation de la crevette doit être entreprise.

Une cellule de suivi et une cellule d'évaluation doivent être créées et coordonnées.

Afin de mettre en place des procédures comptables et une structure organisationnelle plus efficiente, la mission recommande de recourir à des missions d'expertise comptable et administrative. Un état comptable du projet doit être établi et soumis à un audit.

L'équipe des conseillers de pêche doit être renforcée et dotée d'outils de travail plus fonctionnels. Un accord avec le Centre de Recherche Océanographique permettra de rassembler les données nécessaires au suivi biologique et socio-économique des actions du projet.

Pour que les mesures préconisées s'avèrent efficaces, elles doivent s'inscrire dans un care institutionnel qui rallie le consensus des populations attenantes à la lagune et les impliquent dans la mise en oeuvre mais aussi dans la définition globale d'un plan d'aménagement de l'environnement lagunaire.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-CI-AAF-001,[],[],['chute'],['chute']
