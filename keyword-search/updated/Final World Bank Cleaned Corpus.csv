Despite progress in reducing extreme poverty from 17.7 percent in 2002 to 6.6 percent in 2021, the economy contracted by 7 percent in 2020. However, it rebounded with 10.7 percent growth in 2021, and unemployment returned to pre-pandemic levels of 10.7 percent in 2022. Climate change negatively affects Colombia's economy and natural resources. Ranked 91st in the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, the country suffered damages from heavy rains in 2010 and 2011. Temperature increases, variable precipitation patterns, and glacier melt impact agriculture and water supply, including high-value crops like coffee and cocoa. Rural households are projected to experience higher income losses than urban households due to climate change. Biodiversity loss in Colombia is driven by climate change and unsustainable land-use. Despite being the second most biodiverse country, Colombia ranks 10th in deforestation, having lost 3.2 million hectares (ha) of natural forests from 2001 to 2021. Deforestation harms species reliant on forests, and many ecosystems are in critical condition or at risk of collapse. Unsustainable land-use and climate change further threaten non-forest ecosystems, exacerbating biodiversity loss. Over 1,300 species in Colombia face extinction. Colombia has committed to addressing biodiversity loss through the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Sectoral context. To address climate change, Colombia seeks to transition to a low-emission economy supported by sustainable productive landscapes over the next eight years. Its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) targets a reduction of projected GHG emissions by 51 percent by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector accounts for the largest share (59.1 percent) of the country’s total net GHG emissions. The mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector derives from both the reduction of GHG emissions through REDD+ and livestock good practices, as well as an enhancement of GHG removals. Deforestation and enteric fermentation from livestock represent the main categories of GHG emissions, while most (66 percent) of the GHG removals occur on forest lands, followed by crop lands, grasslands, and harvested wood products. The NDC pledges to reduce deforestation by 68.5 percent from 158,900 ha in 2019 to 50,000 ha by 2030; it also presents a US$200M strategy to reach zero-net deforestation. Institutional context. Multiple government entities at national and regional levels promote sustainable low-emission development in Orinoquia particularly since the change of the Government of Colombia (GoC) administration in August 2022. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MinAmbiente) and the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM) are leading the environmental and climate change agendas. They collaborate with other entities such as the two regional environmental authorities in Orinoquia, Autonomous Regional Corporations CORPORINOQUIA and CORMACARENA. In the agricultural sector, the Direction of Innovation, Health Protection, and Technological Development of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MinAgricultura) works alongside the Unit for Rural Agricultural Planning (UPRA) and is broadening the collaboration to the Rural Development Agency (ADR) on extension services. Other relevant GoC entities include the National Planning Department (DNP), the National Land Agency (ANT), departmental governors, and municipalities. The Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research (AGROSAVIA) spearheads knowledge generation and dissemination on low-emission agriculture practices. These institutions are part of the Regional Climate Change Committee for Orinoquia (NORECCO) within the National Climate Change System (SISCLIMA). NORECCO promotes and supports coordinated implementation of public policies, strategies, plans, programs, and projects. The World Bank has supported GoC's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the AFOLU sector since 2010, including readiness grants from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) totaling US$8.73 million to establish foundational elements for REDD+ at the national level, namely the National REDD+ Strategy; Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system; and National Forest Reference Emissions Level (NFREL). From 2018 to December 2023, the World Bank's BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (BioCF-ISFL) has provided US$20 million in investment financing through the Sustainable Low-Carbon Development in Orinoquia Region Project (BioCarbon Project, P160680). The BioCarbon Project has financed updates and qualitative upgrades to land-use planning instruments, intersectoral coordination, development of low-emission productive practices for rice, livestock (dairy and meat), cocoa, cashew, commercial forestry, and palm oil, private sector involvement in low-emission platforms, and design of the BioCarbon Emission Reductions Program Orinoquia (BioCarbon ERP Orinoquia or ERP). The GoC aims to pilot an integral, jurisdictional GHG initiative in the Orinoquia region, encompassing REDD+ and agriculture. In 2018, the Orinoquia region accounted for 15.1 percent of Colombia's total net GHG emissions (42 million tCO2e), with 15.9 percent attributed to emissions and 25.5 percent to removals. Within Orinoquia, AFOLU accounted for the largest share of emissions (78.7 percent), primarily from deforestation (73 percent), and enteric fermentation from livestock (24 percent). Relation to CPF. The ERP aligns with the World Bank Group's CPF 2016-2021 and contributes to Pillar 1 by enhancing natural resource management capacity in targeted regions. It supports the CPF's cross-cutting theme of Constructing the Peace by promoting an approach that combines peacebuilding and environmental sustainability goals. Developed under the Orinoquia BioCarbon Project, the ERP builds upon the FCPF Readiness Project (P120899). It synergizes with ongoing projects such as the ISFL-funded Developing Climate-smart Agricultural Supply Chains (P173540), the GEF-funded Orinoquia Integrated Sustainable Landscape Project (P167830) and the Forest Conservation and Sustainability in the Heart of Colombian Amazon Project (P171227), and the World Bank's Multipurpose Cadaster Project (P162594) and its Additional Financing (P172972). Additionally, the ERP complements an Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR, P178104). The Global Practice on Agriculture and Food Multi-phased Programmatic Approach includes the Sustainable Family Farming in Colombia Project (P180676) as phase 1, which aligns with the ERP in developing and implementing 41 sustainable agriculture practices prioritized for farmers in Orinoquia to achieve Emission Reductions (ER). The ERP The proposed ERP involves an Emission Crediting Transaction supported by an agreement called Emission Reductions Payment Agreement (ERPA). The ERPA will be signed between the Republic of Colombia, represented by MinAgricultura and MinAmbiente, and the World Bank as the implementing agency of the BioCF ISFL. Results-based payments for verified ERs will provide incentive financing for implementing a set of 41 low-emission and climate-smart ERP measures. The ERPA allows the GoC to sell ERs to the highest bidder. The ERP integrates grant funding from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for a pilot on monitoring biodiversity results in productive landscapes with focus on rice, livestock, and palm oil value chains, and an additional BioCF-ISFL grant for ERP management. The Emissions Crediting Transaction does not directly finance the ERP measures that generate the ERs.

The proposed project would be financed with a US$100 million IBRD loan, US$17 million financing from the Canadian Clean Energy and Forest Climate Facility (CCEFCF), US$ 8.0 million from the Food System 2030 Umbrella Program (FS2030), US$15 million counterpart funding from FINAGRO, and, at least, US$99 million from private financing. FINAGRO will be the borrower and implementing entity. The project will improve productivity, strengthen the capacity to adapt to and mitigate climate change conditions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, also leveraging the Bank’s global knowledge and experience specialized in strengthening agrifinancial institutional capacity. The project consists of three components: (1) Strengthening financial sector institutional capacity, (2) Access to sustainable finance for agrifood system, and (3) Project management. Component 1. Strengthening agrifinancial sector’s institutional capacity and repurposing agriculture support policies (US$ 2 million FINAGRO; and US$ 8.0 million FS2030). Under this component, the project will finance the provision of technical assistance, capacity building, training, and institutional strengthening of FINAGRO, FINAGRO´s Agricultural Partial Credit Guarantee - FAG, and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to enable small low-income farmers, and medium-scale farmers in Colombia to access sustainable financing to implement CSA and agri-businesses. This component will also help institutions linked to the agricultural sector transform the agrifood system by redirecting resources from harmful and distorting practices to more sustainable ones through the repurposing of agrifinance support programs. Subcomponent 1.1. Enhancing the institutional capacity of the agrifinancial sector (US$ 2 million FINAGRO). This subcomponent would finance, inter alia: (a) provision of technical assistance to improve FINAGRO’s capacity to structure climate-smart credit programs; (b) develop and implement a data management system which collects and monitors beneficiaries’ personal and subloan data for reporting purposes; (c) strengthen FINAGRO´s recently created Sustainable Finance Unit; (d) improve the capacity to integrate climate change risks, costs, and opportunities into FINAGRO’s business model; (e) implement capacity building programs aimed at PFIs, including the development and/or improvement of their Environmental and Social Management Systems; and (f) conduct knowledge exchanges on strategies and operational approaches to agricultural finance.Subcomponent 1.2. Repurposing agriculture support policies (US$ 8.0 million FS2030). This subcomponent will support MADR with, inter alia, (a) conducting of a comprehensive review of the existing CSA technologies available, and develop technical materials and technical agriculture delivery mechanisms for the identified CSA technologies; (b) studying the existing financing support programs to the agriculture sector, identify areas of improvement and propose policy changes. This activity also involves designing and implementing repurposing pilots to reorient public support towards CSA technology adoption, providing technical assistance for the modernization of policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks governing the agriculture sector to mainstream climate change and food security and nutrition targets, and developing and implementing a communication strategy to inform the public and private sector about the drawbacks of these publicly supported programs and the benefits of reform. Furthermore, this subcomponent will help FINAGRO finance, inter alia, (c) the design and implementation of sustainable financing products to promote the adoption of CSA technologies: this activity also involves assessing options and covering related costs to ensure the integrity and credibility of climate change mitigation efforts (i.e. certification bodies, government agencies, international organizations, others), particularly in the context of carbon markets. Component 2. Access to sustainable finance for agrifood systems (US$99 million IBRD; US$17 million CCEFCF; US$12 million FINAGRO; US$99 million private financing). This component will finance the provision of lines of credit and partial credit guarantees to eligible PFIs, which in turn will provide subloans for climate-smart investments to final borrowers in the agricultural sector. These subloans will cover final beneficiaries´ investment needs, especially those investments requiring long-term to be repaid. By way of example, FINAGRO will classify subloans that align with CSA eligibility criteria into four credit types: (a) On-farm irrigation technologies and practices to improve water use efficiency; (b) Clean energy and energy efficiency; (c) Technology and machinery to improve nutrient use efficiency, and (d) Sustainable agricultural systems and carbon-smart technology. The total amount of the IBRD loan will be allocated to finance CSA investments. Moreover, 50 percent of the total number of subloans disbursed under the project will support women farmers. Subcomponent 2.1. Sustainable line of credit (US$99 million IBRD; US$17 million CCEFCF; US$12 million FINAGRO; US$37 million private financial intermediaries; and US$18 million final borrower). Under this component, the Project will support FINAGRO in promoting access to sustainable financing for agricultural farmers to facilitate the transformation of agrifood systems through CSA investments. Under this subcomponent, the Project will channel subloans with longer maturities to eligible farmers and Integradores. Longer maturities of subloans are critical for capital investments by offering borrowers stability and flexibility. This enables them to invest towards technology adoption, fixed asset acquisition, and infrastructure development that enhances resilience and adaptation to climate change or contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in agrifood production systems. By aligning the duration of the subloan with the lifecycle of the capital project, longer-term financing minimizes the risks associated with refinancing or repayment issues, ensuring a more secure financial environment for all parties involved.Subcomponent 2.2. Partial credit guarantee for long-term sustainable subloans (Total cost US$40 million private financial intermediaries; US$ 4 million final borrowers). Under this subcomponent, the Agricultural Partial Credit Guarantee, financed by the MADR and managed by FINAGRO, will help private PFIs mitigate the credit risk of final borrowers by providing partial credit guarantees for subloans disbursed following the CSA eligibility criteria of the Project. Under this subcomponent, the FAG will use their own funds to encourage long-term financing offered by private commercial PFIs to farmers who are interested in adopting CSA technologies to grow their businesses but whose lack of collateral limits their capacity to get access to finance from the formal financial system. In this sense, the FAG seeks to improve conditions for longer-term financing offered by PFIs, while sharing with the PFIs the risks that might affect the repayment of subloans in the event of a default by the borrower. This subcomponent will crowd-in at least US$40 million from private commercial PFIs in subloans backed with FINAGRO´s Agricultural Partial Credit Guarantee to finance CSA investments following the eligible criteria of this project in addition to the volume of subloans disbursed under subcomponent 2.1. The eligibility requirements for PFIs and the exclusive use of the FAG for loans in this subcomponent will align with those of subcomponent 2.1.Component 3. Project Management (US$1 million IBRD; US$1 million FINAGRO). Under this component, FINAGRO, as a borrower and implementing entity, will form a Project Coordination Team (PCT).

The selection of these states is based on their mitigation potential in the forestry and agricultural sectors, as well as their political commitment to integrated landscape management.For the GoM, this program represents an opportunity to scale up various interventions at the forest-landscape level to better address the main drivers of deforestation and degradation. The Program recognizes that deforestation and forest degradation are complex and multifactorial phenomena, especially considering that in Mexico forests are found in multiple land use landscapes and deforestation is not only determined by direct productive activities but also by underlying causes involving multiple stakeholders. Thus, the program seeks to: (i) strengthen intersectoral collaboration to better align investments in forest landscapes, (ii) reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the land sector and improve forest livelihoods through the promotion of activities to conserve and sustainably use and restore forest landscapes, (iii) maintain and enhance Mexico’s capacity to monitor and report GHG emissions. By achieving the Program objectives, the GoM will enhance its capacity to access new sources of climate finance.Mexico’s Emissions Reduction Program will adopt a programmatic approach beginning with interventions in the LULUCF sector and aiming to transitioning a potential second phase to emissions reductions from the AFOLU sector.

Afro-descendants correspond to 57 percent of the State population - and they account for most of the economically vulnerable population. The GDP of Rio Grande do Norte corresponds to approximately 1 percent of Brazil’s national GDP. Rio Grande do Norte covers an area of 52,810km² (815.53 km² urbanized), and is the third smallest compared to the nine states in the Northeast region, Brazil's poorest. Most of the state (93 percent) lies within the Sertão, the semi-arid region of the NEB which is disproportionately prone to climate change effects. Road transport is key for Rio Grande do Norte logistics, but the sustainability of its assets is at risk due to poor maintenance and safety and climate resilience challenges. RN is traversed by 1,480 kilometers (km) of federal roadways and 4,540 km of state roads—of which 3,464 are paved, which are key for State logistics. The first phase of the Project (P126452) has implemented 274 km of State roads, but due to a lack of resources, the state still has significant physical bottlenecks in its road system – 24,3 percent of the State Road network is in bad condition, and 40.2 percent in regular – showcasing its challenges to maintain the road network, with no experience in implementing performance-based contracts (PBCs). Additionally, low capacity in the Government to act towards climate resilience compounds the emergency costs for roads in rainy years such as 2023-2024. RN roads continue to lack adequate safe road designs – especially in urban settlements – and maintenance of road infrastructure. According to data from the Ministry of Health, between 2019 and 2021, road traffic fatalities have remained stable in RN, with 392 traffic-related deaths in 2022 (11.9 fatalities per 100k inhabitants). While agricultural production in RN only contributes 3.4 percent to the state’s overall GDP, it is still a driving force in the labor market, accounting for one-third of the state’s labor force. Moreover, there is an urgent need for an upgrade in farm-to-market infrastructure to ensure better commercial access, particularly around the key production centers. According to the 2017 Census, there were 50,680 family farms, representing 80 percent of the 63,350 farms statewide. Past surveys showed less than two percent of family farmers were members of agricultural cooperatives, 23 percent were members of associations, 46 percent were affiliated with the Rural Workers Unions (STRs), and almost 30 percent did not engage in any kind of collective organization. Cooperatives of family farmers face difficulties with obtaining Federal Government Food Safety certification (SIF/MAPA), a significant barrier for accessing markets. Whilst these barriers are being slowly overcome, rural market access is impeded during the wet season when roads become impassable. As experience from the previous project shows, better-quality road pavement leads to agricultural sales increase, as this has been clearly demonstrated by the milk and fruit sectors.Tourism activity accounts for 8 percent of Rio Grande do Norte’s GDP and contributes to over 100 thousand formal jobs. Between 2002 and 2020, the share of value added from services to the state’s economy – tourism included – grew from 66 percent to 77 percent. However, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the State lost a significant number of incoming international flights which are yet to resume, reducing foreign currency income. Tourism in the state continues to suffer from a lack of diversification; over 90 percent of visitors during peak seasons visit or plan to visit beaches – benefitting larger companies rather than community-based tourism, while only 14 percent visit or plan to visit inland cities. The proposed Project aims at developing the agriculture and tourism sectors of five key hubs for the economy of the state, while improving transport access with a safer, climate resilient, and sustainable road asset management strategy. Those five hubs have been selected based on the findings of a study commissioned by the state during implementation of Phase 1, which considered, inter alia: volumes of farm credit for capital expenditures and fixed costs; federal fiscal incentives and state fiscal incentives for industrial development given since 2003, linkages with road infrastructure, presence of traditional communities and rural settlements, and market sales potential, including for exports. The five hubs are: (i) Costa Branca region, where there is cluster of fruit cooperatives, (ii) Sertão region, where there is a cluster of cotton cooperatives; (iii) Serido region, where cheese production by women groups (cheese making/queijeiras) predominate, (iv) “Rota do Frio”, where honey production is being developed, and (v) Costa Mar, where animal protein is the key livestock/agricultural output. In doing so, the project will invest in family farming resilience (climate adaptation/mitigation, productivity, and marketing of products) and in an enabling a better business environment for the cooperatives and tourism organizations in these regions to flourish. Crucially, there will be a significant investment in safe and resilient access to road infrastructure to ensure full access to markets and complement the sector-specific interventions.COMPONENT 1 – Access to markets and improved climate resilience of family farmersSub-component 1.1 - Linking family farmers to markets Sub-component 1.2 - Strengthening family farming institutions and systemsSub-component 1.3 - Strengthening the enabling environment for family farming and sustainable community-based tourism market development COMPONENT 2 – Improving sustainable, safe, and resilient access to transport in RNSub-component 2.1: Proactive maintenance CREMA-DBM: Long-term performance-based safe and resilient road management contracts for state road corridorsSub-component 2.2 -State Infrastructure improvement using Public-Private PartnershipsSub-component 2.3 Institutional strengthening, covering three sets of activities: proactive, safe, and resilient road asset management; green mobility and logistics; and social inclusion and genderCOMPONENT 3 - Project Management and Institutional Strengthening",,[],['market access'],[],[],"['livestock', 'market access', 'milk']",[],"['livestock', 'market access', 'milk']"

The country boasts 2.9 billion m³ of trees, with 72% located in semi-evergreen miombo-dominated forests. However, with rural poverty levels averaging 80%, rural communities heavily depend on these natural resources for survival. Majority if not most of Zambia’s rural population relies directly on natural resources for fuel, food, income, raw materials, and medicines.Deforestation and forest degradation are the biggest threats to Zambia’s forests, putting the economy and environment at risk. As of 2021, Zambia's forest cover was estimated at 45.4 million hectares, representing 60% of the country's total land area, with an average deforestation rate of 172,000 ha/year and forest degradation of 38,400 ha/year. The primary drivers include land use changes due to population growth, agricultural expansion, infrastructure development, mining, and wood extraction for fuelwood. Uncontrolled forest fires and unregulated charcoal production further exacerbate these issues, leading to biodiversity loss, reduced forest productivity, and diminished ecosystem services. Other negative impacts include, soil erosion, flooding, high evapotranspiration, water and food insecurity, displacement of people and reduced hydropower generation. Climatic impacts such as droughts are forcing migration from certain regions of the country to others, leading to exertion of pressure on relatively intact forested areas. Charcoal production, especially in urban areas, is a significant driver of deforestation, exacerbated by power outages due to prolonged drought. Agricultural expansion, particularly smallholder farming, also contributes to deforestation through increased production areas and shifting cultivation due to poor crop management practices. Weak governance and poor implementation of forest management practices further aggravate deforestation, necessitating effective governance to regulate land use and control deforestation. The management of natural resources in Zambia is hindered by a lack of coordination among institutions, insufficient manpower, and limited technical capacity within the relevant ministries and departments. TRALARD II is designed to address this context of environmental and climatic vulnerability, further hindered by limited institutional capacity and policy enforcement. The project will be implemented in Luapula, Northern, Muchinga, Southern, and Copperbelt provinces, where deforestation due to agriculture, charcoal production, and logging is widespread, leading to habitat loss, soil degradation, and reduced biodiversity. Erratic rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts, particularly in Southern Province, exacerbate water scarcity and food insecurity. Overgrazing, unsustainable farming practices, and mining activities contribute to land degradation and pollution. Climate change has worsened these problems, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, further stressing local ecosystems and communities.TRALARD II will support the implementation of Zambia's first National Green Growth Strategy 2024–2030, investments in climate-smart livelihoods, and knowledge management. It will build on the successes and lessons of TRALARD, implemented in Luapula, Muchinga, and Northern Provinces until December 2025. In these provinces, TRALARD II will consolidate achievements and scale up good practices and lessons learned to Central, Copperbelt, Northwestern, and Southern Provinces. Key focus areas include diversified and sustainable livelihoods, operationalizing climate-resilient infrastructure, establishing new community forest management and natural forest regeneration areas, and improving the management of existing Protected Areas. TRALARD II will leverage the existing implementation arrangements and the capacity developed under TRALARD, particularly in Environmental and Social (E&S) risk management, procurement, and financial management and FM audits. Institutionally, the Ministry of Green Economy and Environment (MoGEE) will continue to oversee the project. The National Project Coordinating Unit (NPCU) in charge of TRALARD will lead TRALARD II preparation and implementation under MoGEE's coordination. Relevant line ministries will provide support needed for impacts at landscape level: Department of Forestry, Department of National Parks and Wildlife under the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Agriculture, Provincial Administrative Office, Zambia Meteorological Department, Ministry of Small Medium Enterprises, and Ministry of Water Development and Sanitation. TRALARD II will be developed through the following components:Component 1. Fostering Implementation of the National Green Growth Strategy (GGS): Component 1 will finance capacity building, technical assistance (TA), and other enabling activities to (i) enhance policy frameworks and related technical capacities of key stakeholders, including state and non-state actors and local communities for forest management and conservation, rehabilitation of degraded land, biodiversity conservation, and climate change adaptation in priority areas; (ii) develop integrated land management (ILM) plans; (iii) promote creation of green jobs and value chains; and (iv) create the conditions for a prioritized province to access carbon markets. The latter will cover preparation of a jurisdictional Emission Reduction Program (ERP) in a selected TRALARD province and develop capacity at various government levels and among producers for ILM and emission reductions at the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. Component 1 will also continue TRALARD investments in strengthening the climate and hydro-meteorological information system. Component 2. Promoting Climate-Smart Livelihoods and Value Chains and Green and Inclusive Jobs: Component 2 will finance physical investments and works to implement GGS measures fostered under Component 1, aligned with the ILM approach to achieve social, economic, and environmental objectives. It will address deforestation and forest degradation in high-value forest areas while providing grants for climate-resilient livelihoods and green jobs for local communities. Component 2 will fund (i) participatory Community Forest Management (CFM); (ii) strengthened management of Protected Areas and establishment of new conservation areas around threatened headwaters; and (iii) conservation and rehabilitation of prioritized productive landscapes with focus on drought resilience, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and biodiversity-friendly production practices. It will support development of non-timber forest product (NTFP) value chains, reduction of post-harvest losses, and natural regeneration and re-vegetation through assisted natural regeneration (ANR) and tree planting, thus increasing forest cover and restoring degraded lands.Component 3. Project and Knowledge Management, Coordination, and Collaboration: Component 3 will ensure effective project management and coordination and execution of activities while capturing and sharing lessons learned throughout the implementation period. Along with planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), fiduciary management, environmental and social risk management, and reporting, Component 3 will support documentation, awareness raising and sensitization efforts on good practices, lessons learned, and innovative solutions for integrating forestry, ecosystem restoration, and economic development. Along with promotion of interinstitutional and cross-sectoral collaboration among stakeholders, the knowledge products will inform ongoing and future initiatives and enhance project outcomes and sustainability.",[],[],[],[],[],"['overgrazing', 'smallholder']","['overgrazing', 'smallholder']"

In the entire Miombo eco-region, Zambia has the highest diversity of trees and is the centre for endemism for Brachystegia tree species - one of the Miombo woodland’s key species. The miombo woodlands in Zambia are a vast and diverse ecosystem that covers approximately two-thirds of the country's land area. Socioeconomically, miombo woodlands are a vital source of livelihood for rural communities who depend on them for firewood, charcoal, timber, and non-timber forest products such as mushrooms, honey, and medicinal plants. Overall, the forest sector is important to the Zambian economy, essentially because most people depend on the use of natural resources for their survival. Forests are estimated to employ 1.4 million people, and 60% of rural households heavily depend upon the use of natural resources. In addition, miombo woodlands provide grazing lands for livestock and support ecotourism activities such as birdwatching, hiking, and wildlife viewing. Forests provide 80% of the energy needs in the form of firewood and charcoal. They contribute about 4.7% of GDP to the national economy or $957.5 million annually to about 6.3% ($1277 million) when multiplier effects of forest and tourism-related activities on other sectors are considered. However, the miombo woodlands are under pressure due to large-scale clearing of land for commercial agriculture, settlements and infrastructure development, livestock grazing and generally land use change. Also, in places with high population, traditional practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture and livestock grazing are having a negative impact on forests. These practices are leading to deforestation, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity. Finally, climate change is having an impact on the miombo woodlands, with changes in temperature and rainfall patterns affecting the growth and distribution of tree species. Environmentally, miombo woodlands play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance - they help to regulate the water cycle by capturing and storing rainfall, which supports both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Miombo woodlands also act as carbon sinks, sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigating the effects of climate change. Furthermore, miombo woodlands are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including endemic and threatened species such as the African elephant, African wild dog, and sable antelope. Protecting miombo woodlands and their biodiversity is therefore, essential for the conservation of Zambia's natural heritage, socioeconomic benefits and multiple global environmental benefits.This project will build on lessons from the Transforming Landscapes for Resilience and Development (TRALARD) Project (P164764) ($87.2 million 2019 – 2025 in Luapula, Northern and Muchinga provinces). With a focus on promoting diversified, resilient, sustainable livelihoods and management of community forests and protected areas, TRALARD seeks to improve natural resource management in select districts to support sustainable livelihoods. SMEMZ will be strategically designed to i) catalyze the investments; and ii) scale-up best practices related to transformational approaches to integrated natural resource management from TRALARD while supporting livelihoods of local communities. To catalyze the investments and support scaling up, SMEMZ is proposed to be implemented in Muchinga, Copperbelt and Central provinces which are located in the miombo woodland ecoregion. The Sustainable Management of Ecosystems in Miombo Ecoregions of Zambia (SMEMZ) project is conceived to restore degraded production landscapes, enhance biodiversity conservation, and increase the adaptative capacity of the vulnerable population to cope with climate risks within the Zambian miombo ecoregion using an integrated natural resources management approach. The main objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the climate resilience of the miombo forest and forest-dependent communities in the Copperbelt, Central and Muchinga Provinces of Zambia. This will be achieved through the integration of adaptation considerations in land use planning, implementation of sustainable management practices and the promotion of community-based adaptation.

Recognizing that environmental issues have often impacts across jurisdictions and demand high technical capacity and timely and accurate data for informed decision making at both the national and local levels, the proposed project will support the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable -MAyDS) and participating provincial governments to strengthen their technical capacity, improve their information and physical infrastructure to better manage three selected environmental priorities: wildfire, air quality and waste management. Along with physical investments, the project will support policy and institutional actions to ensure long-term sustainability of capacity and infrastructures developed under the project. Results of this project is expected to help the government develop follow-up operations to further strengthen co-management of other environmental priorities of the country.The Project has four components. The first component (Policy Development and Capacity Building) will support MAyDS and participating local governments on (a) policy development and (b) building technical capacities of public servants and relevant stakeholders to manage the three environmental priorities. A second component (Environmental Information Management) will support MAyDS to improve its physical infrastructure for environmental information management and proper disclosure of critical environmental information through (a) the development of a national air quality monitoring system with fixed and mobile stations in major urban centers (subcomponent 2.1); (b) the development of a national wildfire early warning system with a focus on fire prone areas (subcomponent 2.2); and (c) improvements in infrastructure and operations of the national and provincial environmental information centers (subcomponent 2.3). A third component (Closure of Legacy Dump Sites) will support the closure of about 20 such sites across the country, to new public areas. The targeted sites will have an area between 0.5 to 4 ha. Site-level interventions will include (a) environmentally sound closure of dump sites, (b) collection of landfill gas (methane), (c) post-closure management and monitoring of the dump sites, and (d) new landscaping and facilities for public uses. Based on lessons learned from these 20 sites, this component will support the development of engineering designs and investment plans for 50 additional dump sites. Such investment plans are expected to be presented to interested public and private investors for consideration. A fourth component (Project Management) will support MAyDS to manage project implementation. The mobile air quality monitoring stations (subcomponent 2.1) will be used to carry out year-round air quality monitoring campaigns in extended areas to supplement data from the fixed air quality monitoring stations, monitor air quality affected by fire events, and verify air quality changes before and after the closure of legacy dump sites to be financed by Component 3.Relationship to CPF. By supporting MAyDS and participating local governments, this project will contribute directly to the current CPF (World Bank Group, 2019. Country Partnership Framework for the Argentine Republic for the Period FY19-FY22) in its (a) Objective 5, “Improving service delivery through enhanced inter-jurisdictional coordination”, through improved air quality, waste and wildfire management practices and (b) Objective 10 (building resilient and low carbon cities) through reduced pollution releases including greenhouse gases (GHGs) from wildfires and legacy dump sites. Specifically, such control of GHG releases supports the implementation of the country’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which has called for technical assistance, technology transfer and concessional financing for improved fire management, and listed integrated waste management including methane capture as key mitigation actions (MAyDS, 2020. Segunda Contribucion Determinada a Nivel Nacional de la Republica Argentina).

TRACE is a hybrid Trust Fund (TF), financed by a Dutch contribution of US$23.1M, and will be implemented until the end of 2026. The program's development objective is to create jobs in the agri-food sector by strengthening the productivity and resilience of small- scale producers, and competitiveness of agribusiness cooperatives and SMEs in selected agri-food sub-sectors through better access to knowledge, innovations, and financial services. To stimulate job creation, TRACE acts on four dimensions: (i) addressing the mismatch between the supply and demand of skills in the agri-food sector; (ii) expanding the network and professionalism of producer organizations and agri-SMEs able to connect producers to market opportunities and required services; (iii) developing the range and quality of financial and non-financial services for farmers, agribusiness SMEs, and value chain stakeholders; and (iv) improving the business environment and policy framework to stimulate the growth of a market-oriented and private sector-driven agri-food sector. Activities under Dimensions 1, 3 and 4 are Bank-Executed TF (BETF) activities. Under Dimension 2, it is proposed to establish a fourth entrepreneurship support matching grant project to continue supporting Producer Organizations (POs) and small Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to develop their business and create more jobs through technical and financial assistance. This proposed project will be implemented by Microfinanza as a Recipient-Executed Trust Fund (RETF) project. The proposed RETF project will cover the four governorates in the North-West of Tunisia and capitalize on the activities previously undertaken by two other TRACE RETF projects (P174017 & P175641) in the same region. The proposed RETF project will be composed of three components:Component 1 - Technical assistance to POs and SMEsThe implementation of the entrepreneurship support project will require technical assistance (TA) to SMEs and POs for preparing and selecting technically sound and financially and commercially viable beneficiary sub-projects. Microfinanza – the implementing agency – will deliver this TA directly or through technical partners. The agency will disseminate information to potential POs and SMEs, with a special focus for youth and women entrepreneurs, to select candidates through both an open counter system and calls for proposals depending on the target. This dissemination will include facilitating the dialogue with relevant authorities, private sector associations, and other stakeholders to ensure that the investment sub-project submissions are consistent with the nature of the region and the opportunities and constraints of the sector. The Project will help POs and SMEs develop technically sound and commercially viable businesses through tailored TA. This TA will be delivered individually or in cohorts, based on the specific needs and maturity of the applicants’ sub-projects. The TA will ensure that investment sub-project proposals submitted to the Project have a strong potential to be profitable and sustainable, ensuring business growth and creating jobs, while also improving producers’ resilience and economic inclusion.To ensure the success of selected investment sub-projects, the implementing agency will also provide TA during implementation, either directly or by linking POs and SMEs with specialized technical and managerial expertise. The implementing agency will provide this second phase of TA directly and/or act as a facilitator to help POs and SMEs access additional support from public and private service providers and connect with larger business enterprises and agro-industries to receive advice in order to properly adjust to market requirements. The assistance will be provided individually to more developed POs and SMEs as a form of acceleration support, while less developed POs and SMEs will be grouped into cohorts to achieve economies of scale in the incubation of their initiatives. The overall objective of the technical assistance is to professionalize and expand businesses, increase bargaining power in value chains, improve financial and technical resources, and network to share experiences and best practices. Increasing the scale, productivity, and resilience of business activities will ensure sustainability of the jobs created and will generate additional jobs over time, while indirectly generating job creation for suppliers and clients of the POs and SMEs supported.Component 2 - Grants for agri-food and rural job creation The TRACE entrepreneurship support project will provide non-reimbursable financial contributions (matching grants) to investment sub-projects submitted by POs and SMEs engaged in agri-business activities with the overall objective to help business growth and job creation. For more developed candidates that receive acceleration support, matching grants will be capped to 30% of the cost of the proposed investments. Furthermore, this category of beneficiaries will be required to obtain credit from a bank, leasing company and/or supplier. The maximum grant size for acceleration beneficiaries will be 90,000 TND. For less developed candidates that receive incubation support, grants will be capped to 90% of the cost of the proposed investments. Obtaining credit will be encouraged, but it will not be a requirement for this category of beneficiaries. The maximum grant size for incubation beneficiaries will be 20,000 TND for SMEs and 70,000 TND for POs. For both categories of beneficiaries, the grants will finance small-scale equipment and inputs as well as soft activities (technical and managerial training and advice, marketing guidance and market intelligence, etc.).Eligible activities will cover the wide range of opportunities offered by the agri-food sector and agro-rural entrepreneurship. These activities can range from farming production and processing to agro-service providers (input and technology supplies, advisory services, etc.) and post-harvest operations (storage, processing, packing, etc.). Eligible investment initiatives also include the valorization of cultural and natural resources through handy crafts and rural tourism. Investment sub-projects will therefore be in, but not limited to, agro-industry, agro-food, apiculture, aromatic and medicinal plants, valorization of natural resources, and agro-tourism.Selection will prioritize investments with high job creation potential that are technically sound, commercially viable and environmentally and socially sustainable. Other factors to be considered include tangible scale, identified markets, and partnerships with other producers, private aggregators, agro-industries and other commercial entities. Selection will be done through an open counter system and competitive calls for proposals with differentiated criteria and financing thresholds depending on the type of beneficiary and the type of support (incubation or acceleration). Applicants will benefit from technical assistance delivered by the Project to improve the quality of proposals. SMEs and POs which have been successful in achieving 70% of the objective of their first investment projects and continue to have a high potential for job creation will be eligible for a second grant without going through the competitive selection process. The objective is to ensure impact sustainability and encourage successful SMEs and POs to continue creating jobs. A regional Technical Committee will be responsible of the selection of incubation proposals and monitoring of their implementation. It will include representatives from regional governmental entities, experts, and private sector representatives.

It contributes to food security and provides resources such as meat, milk, cash income, clothing, employment, and capital stock, and it also represents social status. Land cultivation and livestock rearing are the primary livelihood activities for many households, with approximately 81 percent cultivating land and 74 percent owning livestock. The country's livestock is valued at around 2.2 billion dollars with the livestock population at roughly 38.4 million animals, including 11.8 million cattle, 14 million goats, and 12.6 million sheep . Livestock Production predominantly occurs in arid- and semi-arid zones like Eastern Equatoria and the greater Barh el Ghazal regions. Animals are important assets for agro-pastoral communities, often sold for cash or bartered for goods despite slow growth of cross border trade in livestock being hampered by the current civil war in Sudan.Despite its magnitude and significance, the South Sudanese livestock sector does not meet its potential on food security, nutrition, and livelihoods. The sector has immense potential to increase food security and reduce malnutrition, employ a large segment of the population and foster income and national GDP growth. However, due to the long neglect and low investment in the livestock sector , sectoral development gaps are huge. Prevalence of livestock diseases and related animal health challenges and the severe erosion of rangelands and water resources preclude the sector from reaching a productivity level to enhance commercial opportunities around livestock value chains.The development of the livestock sector as a sustained source of food security and decent livelihood is structurally constrained by interlinked challenges. Main challenges are intrinsic to livestock development: poor animal health and high prevalence of diseases compounded by eroded rangelands lead to minimal productivity. Cross-cutting, foundational issues related to gender inequality, fragility and conflict, and institutional misalignments amplify the sectoral difficulties. Beyond economic growth, investing in agriculture is about resilience; resilience to climate change, resilience to market shocks, and resilience in ensuring that communities have access to nutritious food. Therefore, the sustainable development of the livestock sector hinges on solutions that address the technical issues while mainstreaming cross-cutting issues. The main challenges that the project will tackle are: (i) South Sudan suffers from chronic food insecurity and high level of malnutrition despite a large livestock population that is not productive because of poor animal heath, that causes also human health security and precarious livelihoods; (ii) high vulnerability of the livestock sector to climate change’s impact over water and fodder availability which threatens the livelihoods of pastoral and agro-pastoral communities that are relying on these rangelands for grazing and food; (iii) weak governance and regulatory frameworks characterized by inadequate human resource, insufficient budgets and the absence of a robust regulatory framework make access to and competition over natural resources cause unregulated movement of livestock and the spread of zoonotic diseases; (iv) limited participation of women while they are primarily responsible for animal care, including health monitoring and milking, alongside their duties of managing household responsibilities in the livestock sector is a big hindrance to the development of the sector; and (v) South Sudan is one of the most fragile countries in the world and is exposed to multiple risks of fragility, conflict, and violence that are affecting the livestock sector.The proposed project will address these challenges by supporting the government to invest in (i) animal health to enhance the health and thus the production and productivity of the animals through the provision of technical assistance and vaccines, (ii) improved natural rangeland management, resilient livestock production and adoption of enabling livestock policy bills to facilitate an integrated sector.",['livestock'],"['animal health', 'livestock', 'rangeland']",['livestock'],[],[],"['animal health', 'cattle', 'goats', 'grazing', 'livestock', 'meat', 'milk', 'pastoral', 'rangeland', 'sheep', 'zoonotic']","['animal health', 'cattle', 'goats', 'grazing', 'livestock', 'meat', 'milk', 'pastoral', 'rangeland', 'sheep', 'zoonotic']"

Phase I, which closed on June 30, 2024, was a regional operation (P152822) that covered Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Uganda. A sister regional project in Kenya (P161067) closed on April 28, 2024. A second phase of DRDIP is currently being implemented in Ethiopia (P178047). This operation (P510476) will be exclusively for Uganda, though will remain part of the DRDIP Series of Projects.Uganda is the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa and the fifth largest worldwide. Uganda currently hosts over 1.8 million refugees, most of whom originate from South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The majority of refugees face protracted displacement and reside in settlements, which are mostly located in the periphery of the country. The refugee-hosting areas are generally poor. In some cases, the development challenges in these locations are exacerbated by the refugee presence, which can place a strain on access to basic services, such as education, health, water and sanitation. The refugee presence also offers significant economic opportunities through labor, remittances, existing capital and by attracting humanitarian and development assistance.Uganda's progressive policies for refugee protection are recognized worldwide. Uganda is a signatory to the Global Compact on Refugees. Its legal framework provides refugees with key rights, including the right to access land inside refugee settlements. The 2010 Refugee Regulations and also integrate refugee concerns into local development plans. Project ObjectiveThe project development objective is to improve access to basic social and economic services, expand economic opportunities and enhance environmental management for host communities and refugees in the target areas.As per Phase I, the main implementation approach will be community driven development (CDD), whereby host communities and refugees will be facilitated to analyze their own development problems, identify solutions and then implement and maintain their own subprojects, working with the local government.In addition to enhancing access to services, environmental management and economic opportunity, the project will also include a strong focus on strengthening social cohesion between refugees and host communities. Project Financing and ComponentsThis US$328 million project will include US$295 million from the IDA Window for Host Communities and Refugees (WHR). Activities will be implemented through five components:1. Social and economic services and infrastructureThis component will support community-based infrastructure to enhance access to and quality of basic services, such as education, health, water supply and sanitation. It will also support economic and connective infrastructure, including roads, bridges and markets. Three sub-components will be supported, including: (i) Community & Strategic Investment Fund; (ii) Strengthening Local Planning and Decentralized Service Delivery; and (iii) Displacement Crisis Response Mechanism.2. Integrated natural resource managementThe project will support Integrated Natural Resource Management activities to mitigate the impact of the refugee presence on the environment and to contribute to the addressing Uganda's major land degradation crisis. Most activities will be implemented using a Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) approach to put cash in the hands of poor host community members and refugees. There will be two sub-components: (i) Restoration of degraded ecosystems; and (ii) Expansion of tree cover. 3. Economic Opportunity This component will enhance economic opportunities and investment capacity of host communities and refugees across agriculture, livestock, and non-farm enterprises. It strongly aligns with the Government of Uganda’s strategic emphasis on agri-business-based industrialization, value addition, entrepreneurship mindset, and economic transformation. The component will support accelerated investments in priority value chains, advance the integration of science, technology, and innovation, and expand access to finance. There will be two sub-components: (i) Resilient value chains and enterprise investments; and (ii) Advancing community institutions for market integration. 4. Project management, accountability systems and coordinationThis component will ensure effective management, monitoring and evaluation and learning for the project implementation support team. For Phase II under this component a particular emphasis will be placed on strengthening the capacity of the Office of the Prime Minister to coordinate and oversee the extensive portfolio of humanitarian and development assistance for refugee inclusion in Uganda. The Inspectorate of Government will support transparency, accountability and anti-corruption measures. 5. Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC)Under the CERC, in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency, funds may be reallocated from other components of the project. This component, if activated, would finance rapid response measures and early recovery activities to address disaster, emergency and/or catastrophic events at the community level.Geographic coveragePhase II will cover the 12 Refugee-Hosting Districts. The project coverage area will also be expanded to include selected transit districts and secondary cities. The project will run from for six years from 2025 to 2031.

The inter- and intra-community movement restrictions through lockdowns and curfews imposed by governments have caused significant disruptions to the economic connectedness that drive and sustain local, regional, and national supply and demand in output and input markets. The proposed project will respond to the threat of COVID-19 to food, nutrition, and income security by supporting the Soroti Sweet potato Producers and Processors Association (SOSPPA) to increase its investment in production, processing, and value addition of biofortified orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) products. Sweet potato is a versatile and resilient crop with proven performance in diverse agro-ecologies including in low-input smallholder production systems and in rebuilding livelihoods of farm households and communities after droughts, floods, or displacement. The crop provides reliable yields of at least 8 t/ha under varying climatic and soil conditions, making it one of the fastest expanding food crops in Africa over the past 20 years. Biofortified orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) varieties, rich in beta-carotene, are highly effective in combating vitamin A deficiency among children under 5 years of age and pregnant and lactating women. The overarching goal of the project is to build the capacity and resilience of SOSPPA to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other shocks by improving food, nutrition, and income security of its members.

The proposed project aims to address three critical constraints to improved livelihoods of smallholder livestock keepers in Cambodia. The constraints are (i) low productivity, (ii) low incomes, and (iii) loss of livelihood from animal diseases and climate hazards. First, the project will promote adoption of climate-smart technologies to improve productivity, resilience, and climate mitigation. Second the project will enhance commercialization through better market access, value chain infrastructure, and stronger producer groups. Finally, it will protect smallholder productivity gains by improving animal health services, thereby reducing disease risks. The project will prioritize three livestock value chains, namely cattle, pigs, and poultry in three provinces - Battambang, Tbong Khmum, and Kampong Speu. The project has three components: Component 1 - Promote Inclusive and sustainable Livestock Value Chains: This component aims to sustainably improve the productivity of livestock production and orient farmers towards commercial production. This will be done through (i) the promotion of improved climate-smart technologies and practices, (ii) strengthening producer organizations, (iii) upgrading select, strategic value chain infrastructure, and (iv) improving linkages between producer organizations and agribusinesses for enhanced marketing of produce. Sub-component 1.1. Enhancement of livestock productivity. This sub-component will enhance the productivity, efficiency and sustainability of livestock production through; (i) providing grant co-funding to promote the uptake of climate smart technology and practice packages (PaTecs), which include (a) breeding, (b) feed and fodder production, (c) Good Animal Husbandry Practice (GAHP), and (d) animal waste management; and (ii) supporting the functioning of existing producer groups (PGs) and orienting them towards more commercial livestock production through technical assistance. Sub-component 1.2. Promoting smallholder market access. This sub-component will improve smallholder farmers’ access to markets and increase livestock product sales and farmer incomes through (i) facilitating multi-stakeholder engagement opportunities and exposure visits for small-medium enterprises (SMEs), PGs, and farmers to build and manage business/market partnerships; and (ii) upgrading strategic value chain infrastructure, such as slaughterhouses, and market facilities to higher food safety quality standards. Component 2. Enhance animal production and health services. This component will improve national and sub-national capacities to deliver effective and consistent extension and animal health services. This will be achieved through; (i) demonstration farms to showcase improved technologies and practices, (ii) strengthening extension service capacity to promote technology packages in livestock production; and (iii) building the capacity of General Directorate of Animal Health and Production (GDAHP), provincial offices, and village animal health workers to deliver quality animal health services and (iv) strengthening the surveillance system for transboundary animal diseases and zoonoses. Sub-component 2.1. Strengthening animal production service delivery capacity. The project will enhance extension service capacity to promote technology packages in livestock production. The project will support demonstration farms, capacity building of agriculture extension officers and commune agriculture officers, and the development and dissemination of Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) material. Sub-component 2.2. Strengthening animal health service delivery capacity. This sub-component will increase the capacity of national and local institutions to deliver veterinary services and track and manage animal diseases and zoonoses. The project will finance (i) strengthening of capacities of national and local institutions like MAFF, GDAHP, POAHPs, CAOs, and VAHWs to deliver veterinary services through bolstering the workforce, skills, and incentives for last-mile service providers, and (ii) strengthening of disease surveillance and response capacities for prevalent TADs and zoonoses in project locations, through an enhanced local surveillance system. Component 3. Project management and monitoring, evaluation, and learning. This component will ensure effective project implementation to achieve the PDO and set indicators and comply with the World Bank’s environmental, social, and fiduciary requirements. Key activities will be: (i) supporting the day-to-day implementation, coordination, and management of project activities, including planning and execution, financial management (FM), procurement, internal and external audits, and Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) management; and (ii) establishing and operating an effective project monitoring, evaluation and learning system for project management and planning purposes. Geographical targeting. The project will operate in three provinces. These include Battambang and Tbong Khmum, which are cross-border entry points, where incursions of transboundary animal diseases such as Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) and African Swine Fever (ASF), first occurred, thereby providing early warning to the rest of the country against major disease outbreaks, and Kampong Speu, which is an important center of livestock production, which has high livestock density and major animal trade, and is therefore a high-risk area. Beneficiaries targeting. The project’s direct beneficiaries will total about 30,000 - including farmers, staff of GDAHP, POAHP, MoH, MoE, VAHWs, Commune Agriculture Officers (CAOs), traders, and agribusinesses including female (40 percent). The project will mostly target smallholder farmers with high productive and commercialization potential, while also supporting a smaller segment of lower capacity farmers through PGs who exhibit potential and interest to develop their livestock business. The project will also support SMEs that are interested in cooperating with farmers and PGs. The project targeting strategy will include targeted information campaigns to reach out to farmers, including women and business owners, using a transparent, participatory and self-selection processes as has been successfully implemented in Cambodia, e. g. under the Cambodia Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development Project III (LASED III) and the Cambodia Agricultural Sector Diversification Project (CASDP). Additional indirect beneficiaries will be users of upgraded strategic value chain infrastructure, such as slaughterhouses, and market facilities to higher food safety quality standards, and rural communities, who will have better access to animal health and extension services and information. Institutional and implementation arrangements. MAFF will lead project implementation as the implementing agency (IA) via the GDAHP and related technical departments at the national level, alongside the Provincial Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (PDAFF) and POAHP. The IA has established a project management team (PMT), which is led by a Project Director and includes a deputy director, relevant technical experts, administration, procurement, finance, environmental and social standard (ESS), and M&E experts from relevant units of GDAHP and MAFF. The PMT will be responsible for the overall management of project implementation and external communication, including the agreed reporting to the World Bank. The PMT will be physically located in MAFF. A project implementation team (PIT) will be established to support the planning and executing daily activities. During implementation, the IA, through the PIT, will draw on technical expertise and advice from broader MAFF departments and relevant ministries like the MoE and MoH to implement",['livestock'],"['animal health', 'livestock']",[],[],[],"['African swine fever', 'animal health', 'animal husbandry', 'breeding', 'cattle', 'disease surveillance', 'feed', 'livestock', 'market access', 'pigs', 'poultry', 'smallholder', 'swine', 'veterinary', 'veterinary services', 'waste management']","['African swine fever', 'animal health', 'animal husbandry', 'breeding', 'cattle', 'disease surveillance', 'feed', 'livestock', 'market access', 'pigs', 'poultry', 'smallholder', 'swine', 'veterinary', 'veterinary services', 'waste management']"

The project has four components. The first component, enabling environment for climate resilience, will tackle constraints related to the lack of an integrated policy and coordinated institutional response to land degradation and livelihood resilience. This will be achieved through establishing the enabling environment needed and increasing support for building capacity at national, sub-watershed and colline levels for effective climate risk management, sustainable watershed management, climate resilience, and integrated water resource management. This component has two sub-components. The first subcomponent, strengthening policy and regulatory framework, will provide support to policies and capacity at national and local levels for planning and implementing integrated watershed management and for climate resilient practices benefitting socially vulnerable groups (women and youth). The second subcomponent, institutional capacity strengthening at national, watershed, and community level, will directly support national agencies, and provincial and communal administrations, to implement and manage climate and land risks. The second component, adaptive capacity for sustainable watershed management will address the constraints of fragmented and degraded watersheds and limited access to sustainable finance. It aims to reduce the risks of soil erosion, restore degraded lands and natural resources, and improve the longer-term resilience of the watersheds to climate shocks. It will achieve this through supporting sub-watershed level planning, scaling up landscape restoration, and promoting integrated watershed management (IWM), including management of vulnerable slopes and protected areas. Specifically, project activities will support 87 sub-watersheds targeted by the project, covering 80 collines, and restore 38,639 ha of degraded lands. This component has three subcomponents. The first subcomponent, watershed management planning, will address gaps in coordinated planning of land management interventions. The second subcomponent, sustainable watershed management, will implement the watershed management plans prepared under sub-component 2.1. The third subcomponent, improved management of protected areas (PAs) and reserves, will support the effective and sustainable development of Burundi’s protected area system to conserve biodiversity. The third component, community livelihood resilience support, will address constraints related to limited access to finance and the lack of an integrated response to communities’ needs for resilient livelihoods in the face of rising climate and land risks. This component consists of three sub-components. The first subcomponent, climate-resilience planning, will support the development of Colline-level Climate Action Priorities (or CCAPs). The second subcomponent, climate-resilient agriculture and livelihoods, will support implementation of the CCAPs’ identified priorities and interventions with the aim of enhancing climate-resilient livelihoods and climate-smart agriculture for the most fragile collines. The third subcomponent, land certification, will improve land security through systematic land certification in each target colline, as an enabling condition for land security, access to financing, and climate-resilient livelihood investments.

There are several direct and indirect drivers of forest degradation in Lebanon, including drivers (e.g. urban expansion, pests and diseases, overgrazing) that have negative feedback loops leading to an increase in the numbers and intensity of forest fires; climate change has further exacerbated this trend. Forest fires are often attributed to inadequate forest management, lack of fire prevention initiatives, poor law enforcement, insufficient resources for civil defense and the poor awareness amongst the public. The lack of implementation of the current national forest fire strategy and increasing fire incidences due to development and agricultural activities have further degraded and destroyed Lebanon’s forest landscapes. The project will reduce wildfire risks by improving sustainable forest landscape management in selected fire hotspots in Lebanon. The project will support Lebanon to manage (i) forest fire risks and actual occurrences in a more timely and effective manner; and (i) integrating forest fire risk considerations into the sustainable management of selected forest landscapes. The project is consistent with the (i) National Forest Plan (NFP) 2015-2025 which forms the main forestry policy instrument; and (ii) the updated National Forest Fire Management Strategy (2023).The project will have three components: • Component 1 will enhance the enabling environment for wildfire management to avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation at the national, regional, & local levels.• Component 2 will provide investments to support forest and fire management as well as restoration activities in the context of community-based forest management.• Component 3 will focus on establishing a gender-responsive M&E system; implementing a KM/L plan and communications.

Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) ($0 million). In addition, the project has an unallocated amount of $40 million that is intended to be allocated to the credit line under Component 2 upon successful implementation of a pilot on blended finance. The components are interlinked and are jointly addressing some of the key challenges (land constraints and fragmentation, limited access to finance, insufficient skills, weak market and value chain linkages, and climate change) to Rwanda’s agriculture transformation from a subsistence sector to a knowledge-based value creating sector, and leap to a market-driven agri-food system. Component 1 aims to strengthen market and value chain linkages and improve land use efficiency for commercial agricultural production production in 6 value chains (horticulture, beans, maize, cassava, Irish potatoes and rice) using a climate adaptation and mitigation lens. Component 2 is designed to increase access to affordable financial services and products, especially credit, to farmers and cooperatives for commercialization of the sector and to de-risk the sector using market-based insurance mechanisms and fintech solutions. Component 3 funds overall coordination, and project implementation and monitoring.The target project beneficiaries are farmers’ cooperatives, commercial farmers and small and medium-sized agri-enterprises (agri-SMEs) across Rwanda. Proposed Additional Financing (AF)Climate change remains one of the biggest risks to the Rwandan agri-food system with Rwanda ranked 153rd in terms of its vulnerability to climate change (Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index). As such, reducing farmers’ vulnerabilities to climate risks is a key feature of the CDAT design. The project uses a multifaceted approach to reduce climate vulnerabilities in the targeted value chains, which are considered particularly susceptible to drought, flooding, moisture, and heat stress. The approach combines: (i) the use of targeted resilience and locally appropriate Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) adaptation approaches, including climate smart technologies in the agriculture investments; and (ii) provision of appropriate agriculture insurance products to vulnerable farmers and herders. It is intended to contribute to achievement of the triple CSA goals of: (i) increased agricultural productivity and incomes; (ii) enhanced resilience to climate change; and (iii) reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Additional climate change mitigation and adaptation co-benefits can be generated through improved practices, investments and technologies targeted to benefit small-scale farmers and SMEs if an appropriate mechanism is in place. The GoR has requested the World Bank to mobilize grant funding from the Compact with Africa Green Business Fund (CwA-GBF) to pilot an innovative approach to enhance CDAT’s climate impact and demonstrate new approaches for replication and scale up. The proposed AF will provide grants to incentivize and help expand the adoption of CSA practices by CDAT project beneficiaries in selected subsectors. The grants would be disbursed through a Results-based Climate Finance (RBCF) mechanism to be designed and piloted under subcomponent 2.1 Scaling up agricultural finance leveraging the existing credit line. RBCF is a climate finance mechanism that provides a financial reward in the form of grant payments upon achievement of agreed-upon and verifiable climate-related outcomes, particularly emissions reductions and/or removals (ERRs) alongside adaptation and resilience co-benefits.

This was achieved through programs such as the government's Fertilizer Subsidy Program (FSP, 2008-2017), Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ, 2017-2022), and the Ghana COVID-19 Alleviation and Revitalization of Enterprise Support (Ghana CARES). Subsidies provided by the PFJ program put the Government under a heavy fiscal burden. Excluding project-related expenditures, the cost of these subsidies represented half (51%) of expenditures of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA). The PFJ has been linked to higher crop yields, but its implementation had some limitations such as high budget strain on the government, non-adoption of the value chain approach, limited access to agricultural credit, low prioritization of national strategic stock and limited focus on the needs of commercial small, medium, and large-scale farmers. Acknowledging the achievements and shortcomings of the PFJ implementation, the Government of Ghana in 2023 introduced the Planting for Food and Jobs program 2.0 (PFJ 2.0) which now shifts from a model of direct input subsidy to a smart agricultural input -credit system, linked to structured market arrangements.Under this Additional Financing (AF), the World Bank will support key areas of the PFJ 2.0 program, based on their importance in the country's policy priorities and their alignment with the repurposing agenda. These areas include the transformation of the tomato industry and the design and development of Ghana's Agriculture and Agribusiness Platform (GhAAP). The proposed Additional Financing will not affect the PDO or project components but rather add activities to components that are well aligned.

The component aims to improve the grassland sector resilience and adaptation to climate change through: (i) strengthening grasslands capacity for carbon sequestration, maintain and improve existing carbon stocks, boost biodiversity dependent on grassland ecosystem, and contribute towards the global public goods (GPGs) and (ii) enhancing the quality and net primary productivity (NPP) of grasslands as a livestock feed base, helping to improve value chain participants’ access to sustainable and organic food markets. The project will finance infrastructure for grassland improvement, as we as training, demonstrations and extension to support introduction of carbon-capture and carbon-retention grassland management technologies and practices. The specific sites for grassland interventions would be selected during the project preparation using the criteria such as level of degradation, as well as significance for livestock grazing, potential to enhance carbon stock, support to livelihoods of farmers and herders, and improved livestock quality and health. Component 2: Strengthening sustainability and emission reductions in the livestock value chains.Sub-component 2.1: Promoting low emission and resilient livestock production. This Sub-component would support the province’s efforts to promote the overall greening of the main livestock value chains being developed in the different counties. For this, the adoption of efficient emission-reducing practices and technologies would be piloted in selected, representative intensive production enterprises, which would serve as demonstration units for the dissemination of these improved, environmentally-friendly mitigation practices to other existing and new enterprises, as well as extensionists and private technicians throughout the province. In order to address the entire value chain, thus ensuring the reduced carbon nature of the end products, the promotion of best practices would be supported in breeding grassland-based farms (see Component 1), as well as selected intensive production enterprises, feed supply operations, and processing facilities. Based on the relative importance of livestock production in the province, the value chains to be targeted are sheep, beef and dairy. Subcomponent 2.2: Strengthening of animal health and food safety aspects of the livestock value chains. This component aims to enhance the capacity for preparedness and response, prevention, and control, and minimize risks and impact of priority zoonotic diseases and transboundary animal diseases and other health threats. This component will finance investments to upgrade veterinary services and laboratory capacities and accelerate the adoption of good animal husbandry, food safety and welfare practices in selected livestock value chains contributing to the prominent One Health agenda in China.Component 3: Capacity Building and Project Management.The Component will finance capacity building activities to support the enabling environment for promotion and scaling-up of low emission livestock value chains and sustainable grassland managements. The project will: (i) identify the regulatory and standards gaps for promotion and scale-up of low emission livestock production, processing and logistics and support work for closing these identified gaps; (ii) identify any institutional gaps, and aim to close them during the project implementation, and (iii) support review and strengthening of the existing livestock sector Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems, as well as support development of new MRV protocols for GHG emissions in grassland areas, with a view of enabling sale of the emission reductions resulting from the project in the country’s agricultural carbon markets once they are reopened. The project will also increase awareness and understanding of carbon trading markets among livestock producers in the grassland areas and the public agencies responsible for implementing the MRV protocols, and support development of the regulatory framework required to operate carbon markets, as needed, to ensure the province’s ability to participate in the national carbon markets. Additionally, financing support will be provided to the research community for research into low emission livestock production technologies and climate-smart practices for grassland enhancement. These activities will be carried out at the provincial level, or by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) if their participation in the project is possible.

This MPA (referred to as the Program) provides a flexible menu of interventions aimed at increasing the resilience of food systems and preparedness against food insecurity in participating countries. The Program aims to tackle both the underlying structural challenges of food insecurity and reduce beneficiaries’ sensitivity to unpredictable climate, crisis and conflict events. The Program consists of six components: (i) (Re-)building Resilient Agriculture Production Capacity, (ii) Supporting the Sustainable Development of Natural Resources for Resilient Agricultural Landscapes, (iii) Getting to Markets, (iv) Promoting a Greater Focus on Food Systems Resilience in National and Regional Policymaking, (v) CERC and (vi) Project Management. This first phase of the MPA covers: Ethiopia, Madagascar, the Intergovernmental Development Agency (IGAD) and the Center for Coordination of Agricultural Research and Development for Southern Africa (CCARDESA). Other countries, both IDA and IBRD, yet to be identified, would access the MPA depending on their readiness. EthiopiaThe Food Systems Resilience Program (FSRP) will be implemented in eight National Regional states: Oromia, Amhara, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region (SNNPR), Tigray, Sidama, Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambella, Harari and Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa City Administrations. The project would include 4 major components. Component 1: “Transforming Agricultural Services and Innovation Systems” (under Component of the MPA) promotes the adoption of improved agricultural practices, key to ensuring resilience of food production and food security through farmer-led actions. The component would focus on the entire ecosystem of agricultural services to enable the adoption of improved technologies and sustainable agricultural practices on-farm and post-harvest/production. The component consists of three sub-components: (i) “Promoting Efficiency, Outreach and Efficacy in Agricultural Services” which would strengthen agricultural extension services, support agricultural training services, support plant protection and animal health services, and support public agricultural regulatory services; (ii) “Commercialized Agricultural Technology Generation and Research Systems” would provide support to research activities within both public and private institutions to increase productivity of crop and livestock production and (iii) support the delivery of digital agricultural services (such as agro-meteorology or soil health). Component 2: “Resilient Small-Scale Irrigation Development and Management” (under Component 2 of the MPA) would support the development of irrigation, through small scale irrigation (SSI) schemes and micro-scale irrigation technologies (MSIT). This would include alongside irrigation infrastructure development in SSI, water harvesting structures to enhance water storage at field and watershed level, investments in support of the farmer-led process of accessing, investing, and adopting MSIT. It would consist of two components: (i) Small-Scale and Household Irrigation Development which would develop irrigation infrastructure through the rehabilitation of existing SSI schemes and construction of new irrigation schemes which includes water storage infrastructures such as small dams, ponds/tanks and other relevant community and household water harvesting structures and (ii) Water Management and Infrastructure Governance which would support the establishment of Irrigation Water Users’ Associations (IWUAs) and targeted capacity building to enable them to become effective organizations, capable of managing and maintaining the irrigation systems they are assigned to. Component 3: “Food Market Development” (under Component 3 of the MPA) will improve the competitiveness of strategic agricultural value chains in Ethiopia. It would comprise four su b-components: (i) “Improved Market Services”, which will provide support to strengthen market-related services including digital platforms for facilitating transactions and innovation by value chain actors, ensuring food safety, rehabilitation of feeder roads, improving traceability, trade facilitation, export promotion, and agribusiness regulation and build including financial systems; (ii) “Enterprise Development” which will provide business development, skills training, and incubation support to enterprises (defined broadly as group based (such as Common Interest Groups (CIGs) or cooperatives) or private (sole or partnership proprietorships) and training/awareness on the need to conserve the environment and use of risk-reducing practices/actions to improve resilience to climate change and (iii) Strengthening Smallholder Farmers’ Market Linkages, which will build the capacity of farmers’ organizations and institutions involved in climate-smart value chain development; and (iv)“Strengthening value chains” which would, through an analytical approach, identify value chain bottlenecks, coordinate amongst stakeholders, and provide strategic investments to overcome these bottlenecks. This would be through competitive, matching grant to enterprises for the construction of cooling facilities or warehouses, for example. Component 4: “Improving Enabling Environment for Food Systems Transformation, and Project Management” (under Component 4 and 6 of the MPA) would support the creation of an enabling environment for food system as well as provide support to the implementation and monitoring of the Policy. It would also support project management (including fiduciary, procurement and environment and social risk management) and ensure that the Project’s performance and impact are carefully tracked for informed decisions for better project management and result. Component 5: Contingency Emergency Response Component (US$0). Following an adverse natural event that results in a major natural disaster, the GoE may request the World Bank to reallocate project funds to support short-term response and reconstruction efforts. This subcomponent would draw resources from the unallocated expenditure category and/or allow the government to request the World Bank to recategorize and reallocate funds from other project components to partially cover emergency response expenditures. MadagascarThis project is being prepared in the context of a declining performance of agriculture systems, a major threat to Madagascar’s food security. In 2021, Madagascar for the first time joined Haiti, Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen, and 23 other food security “hot-spot” countries around the globe that are struggling to feed themselves. Among this list, Madagascar stands alone as the one country in which conflict is not among key drivers of food insecurity. Madagascar’s acute and increasing vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather events—especially cyclones, flooding, and drought, amplified by accelerating loss of ecosystems and natural resource depletion, are undermining the country’s agriculture and food systems and threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions.Component 1: “(Re-)building Resilient Agricultural Production Capacity.” This component will support improved research and innovations development and the strengthening service, information, and technology delivery systems. It will finance agricultural R&D and the deployment of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) innovations as well as the development of pluralistic and farmer-responsive delivery mechanisms. This component will finance infrastructure (e.g. storage facilities, sheds and barns), goods (seed, fertilizer, etc) and equipment (machinery etc), capacity building, and technical assistance for public or semi-public goods and services such as agricultural research and information systems, extension and advisory services, and risk management tools.

One plank of the proposed support will focus on short term interventions targeting the most vulnerable population. These interventions include: (i) replenishment of the national food security reserve, from which part of the stock will be distributed to vulnerable populations; (ii) animal feed distribution to vulnerable livestock owners; and (iii) procurement and distribution of nutritional supplements to prevent and manage malnutrition. The second pillar of support will focus on the more medium-term interventions to strengthen the resilience and productive capacities of smallholder’s producers to increase production of own food crops and livestock, including: (i) expanding access to quality production inputs (e.g., improved drought resistant seeds, fertilizers/compost); and (ii) improving access to small post-harvest management equipment. Changes to the parent project (the Burkina Faso element) as described below are proposed:Changes to project activities and costs: A total of US$12.1 million in AF resources is allocated to Component 2 (Sustainable landscape management and governance enhancement). Of this, US$1.4 million is allocated to subcomponent 2.1 (Access to natural resources and SLM) to finance a new activity - the construction of 2 biodigesters close to the slaughterhouses in Bobo Dioulasso and Kaya to produce compost/manure for use as a soil fertility amendment in crop production. The manure would be distributed to farmers by the regional directorates in charge of Agriculture in each targeted region based on eligibility criteria to be detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). Besides helping improve soil fertility for increased production, the biodigesters, each with estimated capacity to produce at least 500 tons of compost per year would also help mitigate methane emissions that would have otherwise escaped from the pits where slaughterhouse waste is currently left to decompose. Under subcomponent 2.2 (Sustainable management of infrastructure for access to water), the parent project finances the construction of pastoral water points in rangelands with no or limited access to water, to ensure the sustainable access of pastoralists to new grazing areas and natural forage resources, and to improve capacity to adapt to climate change. Even with current support, significant gaps in availability of water for both agricultural (crop and livestock production) and household use would persist. The proposal is to allocate US$1.7 million in AF resources to scale up parent project support towards water infrastructure. Specifically, the AF will finance the rehabilitation of 60 climate resilient water points (16 simplified water supply systems, 35 manual boreholes and 9 watering pounds) and the construction of nine (09) boreholes for fodder crops irrigation to protect against climate-induced water scarcity. As in the parent project, the management of this infrastructure would be under the control of beneficiary communities.Another US$9.0 million in AF resources will be committed to subcomponent 2.3 (Fodder production) to scale up parent project support to increasing the availability and accessibility of cultivated fodder to complement the supply of grass - helping to secure pastoral farming and herd mobility and improving resilience. The AF will support the procurement and distribution of 2,100 tons of fertilizers, 750 tons of compost, 1,800 tons of drought resistant dual purpose crop germplasm (e.g., cowpea, sorghum, orange fleshed sweet potato, and maize, among others), as well as 900 tons of fodder crop seeds adapted to the agro-ecological conditions to help producers vulnerable from climate change to increase their food and fodder production. In complement, as new activities, the AF will support the production of compost by producers using locally available materials - where possible, and training on climate-smart production techniques and technologies in the framework of integrated soil fertility management. Additionally, US$9.9 million in AF resources will go towards subcomponent 3.3 (Value-chain development and subproject financing), to scale up parent project financing for improving livestock producer access to critical inputs and small productive assets. Unlike the parent project which under this subcomponent mainly targets producer organizations and the private sector, the A F will target vulnerable small-scale livestock producers, including those that are not part of producer organizations. The AF will support the acquisition and distribution of 13,650 tons of animal feeds, including 9,000 tons of agro-industrial by-products, 1,200 tons of fish feed, 1,950 tons of poultry feed, and 1,500 tons of licking stones. These inputs will be distributed at subsidized rates in compliance with existing government guidelines on inputs subsidies. The distribution will be done by the regional directorates in charge of agriculture and livestock production like the other ongoing projects in the agriculture sector. The AF will also support the improved postharvest management of project supported produce through provision of simple postharvest equipment (e.g., storage containers, cleaners, hand mills, shellers, seed removers, and root crop cutters/graters). Support under this activity will prioritize women, youth, and IDPs. This will diversify livelihoods vulnerable to climate change impacts. With the proposed changes the cost of Component 3 for Burkina Faso will increase to US$12.9 million.Lastly, the cost of Component 5 is increased by US$28.0 million. Of this, US$3.0 million would go towards supporting the coordination of the AF activities (subcomponent 5.1 – Project coordination) – including enhancing the technical and organizational capacity of the PIU, ensuring environmental and social safeguards compliance, effective M&E, procurement, FM, and communication, among others. US$25.0 million will go to subcomponent 5.2 (Institutional strengthening), and of this, US$24.0 million will go towards the procurement and delivery of 37,000 tons of food to replenish the national food-stock reserve. The reserve, managed by the National Food Security Stock Management Company (Societe nationale de gestion des stocks de securite alimentaire, SONAGESS), a state-owned national food security stock management enterprise is composed of major staple cereals: maize, rice, and sorghum/millet. Depending on prevailing market prices, procurement will be from local, regional, or international markets. Part of the purchased staple food will be distributed to the vulnerable households in targeted regions using the government existing mechanism. SONAGESS has demonstrated capacity to undertake the proposed food procurement and distribution as evidenced under other World Bank - financed projects . The use of IDA resources to purchase food in the current context is a productive investment as it would prevent the continued adoption of negative coping mechanisms by beneficiaries, including the desperate sale of assets. The balance of US$1.0 million will support the purchase and distribution of nutritional supplements to help address the high levels of malnutrition in children and pregnant and lactating women. This activity will be implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (Nutrition Directorate).",[],[],['livestock'],[],[],"['feed', 'fertility', 'forage', 'grazing', 'livestock', 'manure', 'pastoral', 'poultry', 'slaughterhouse', 'smallholder']","['feed', 'fertility', 'forage', 'grazing', 'livestock', 'manure', 'pastoral', 'poultry', 'slaughterhouse', 'smallholder']"

Even though its share of total GDP has decreased over the last decade, agriculture retains a crucial role in economic growth in The Gambia. The sector contributes around 20 percent of GDP and generates 30 percent of all foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for 80 percent of the rural population, the sector employs nearly half—46 percent—of the country’s labor force, including an estimated 72 percent of the poor and 91 percent of the extreme poor. Agriculture in the Gambia is dominated by subsistence-oriented rainfed crop and livestock production systems. The performance of the agri-food sector has been poor and erratic. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) classifies the Gambia as “a Low-Income Food Deficit Country” facing severe food security issues at both household and national levels. The COVID-19 pandemic will worsen the country food and nutrition insecurity situation. However, agriculture and agribusiness could become robust engines of inclusive growth and job creation. The country has the potential to achieve huge gains in productivity and market share, given its rich natural resource endowment and strong domestic, regional, and international demand for its agricultural products, including rice, groundnuts, cashews, vegetables, and fruits. The design of the proposed project supports The Gambia in transforming the agricultural sector into a competitive and resilient commercial agri-food sector. This transformative change will be achieved through a logical chain of activities: (i) improving the enabling environment for agriculture/agribusiness development by expanding access to markets for producers and SMEs (through better logistics, market infrastructure, critical SPS services, and access roads), improving the policy and institutional framework, and strengthening the coordination and efficiency of value chain actors; (ii) increasing the productivity and competitiveness of producers and SMEs, as well as their resilience to climate change, by expanding access to climate-smart technologies, inputs, and services; and (iii) increasing private investment along the value chains by strengthening the key public and private institutions responsible for promoting and mobilizing private investment and by providing support services (technical, managerial, and financial) to agribusiness operators. The World Bank Group (WBG) Gambia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2021–26 (under preparation) and recently completed Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), “Overcoming a No-Growth Legacy,’’ fully support the national vision and objectives for the agricultural sector. The three CPF Focus Areas recognize that The Gambia can transition out of fragility only by addressing its underlying public service delivery challenges, tackling constraints on development in key economic sectors such as agriculture, and investing in human capital. The proposed project is an integral part of CPF Focus Area 2, which aims to Enable Inclusive and Resilient Private Sector Driven Job Creation through sustained support for government efforts to create an enabling business environment that fuels job creation, by boosting commercial agriculture and increasing access to finance for MSMEs, among other actions.The project will contribute to the achievement of the WBG’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as well as the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of no poverty and zero hunger by 2030. Like other African countries, Gambia—if it is to meet the twin WBG goals and realize the SDGs—must achieve economic growth that is transformational, sustained, inclusive, and pro-poor, capable of lifting the poor one million Gambians, most of whom live in rural areas and depend on agriculture as their main source of livelihood.",[],['smallholder'],[],[],[],['livestock'],"['livestock', 'smallholder']"

The country experienced positive economic growth, but it has been largely driven by gold exports and worker remittances. Poverty in the country increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is increasingly impacting food affordability. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the poverty rate (US$3.2 a day, 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP)) from 9.7 percent in 2019 to 16.2 percent in 2020. Reduced labor income and remittances caused by the pandemic and inflation pushed an additional 700,000 people (11 percent of the population) into poverty and this trend is expected to increase with the poverty rate reaching 25.5 percent in 2022 (at the US$3.65 a day, 2017 PPP poverty line) from 21.8 percent in 2021. Food and fuel prices drove inflation to 11.2 percent in December 2021 from 9.7 percent a year ago but has fallen to 10.8 percent since February 2022. The uncertainties related to the geopolitical and global economic situation are expected to increase inflation in the Kyrgyz Republic to 15.5 percent, thus creating significant further pressure on fiscal and debt management as well as potentially pushing more people into poverty.Sector and Institutional ContextAgriculture is the main source of income and livelihoods in rural areas but is dominated by smallholders both upstream and downstream. The sector contributes about 12 percent to GDP and employs nearly 30 percent of all labor in the country. The sector consists mainly of small-scale production systems with over 470,000 farm units and more than 700,000 rural households that collectively produce over 95 percent of the total agricultural products in the country. Productivity remains below potential. Yields of major crops remain below Central Asia and ECA averages and while livestock numbers have been rising, productivity gains remain small due to low levels of investment, pasture degradation, livestock diseases and insufficient access to veterinary services. Limited access to improved seeds, fertilizer, farm equipment, extension services, and financing remain key challenges to improving productivity. The Kyrgyz Republic is a net exporter of a selected number of commodities (milk, potatoes, horticulture products) with the potential to expand exports if production can meet market requirements. Agri-food enterprises would benefit from improved processing equipment and facilities, and public support in this case would be limited to promoting innovation and modern technologies rather than granting new equipment to enterprises.Relationship to CPFThe proposed project is aligned to the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2019-2022 (Report No. 130399-KG), which seeks to promote diversified, export-oriented, inclusive, and sustainable growth in the Kyrgyz Republic and is focused on improving conditions for private sector growth. The proposed project falls under the CPF Focus Area 1: Strengthen foundations for inclusive private sector-led growth and Focus Area 3: Enhance economic opportunities and resilience. As preparation of the new CPF for 2024-28 is underway, the proposed project would directly contribute to the proposed High-Level Outcome 2 (HLO2) by addressing key constraints to improvements in agricultural productivity and increasing competitiveness of agri-food value chains by adopting climate-smart, modern technologies.Project Description SummaryThe PDO will be achieved through improving production processes and linkages in selected agri-food clusters, strengthening associated national and regional support systems, and promoting climate smart technologies and practices. The proposed project components are as follows:Component 1: Investment for Agri-food Clusters Development. This component would support investments in each selected agri-food cluster by financing producers and productive partnerships among producers and aggregators/processors engaged in production and value addition.Component 2: Strengthening Institutions and Systems. This component would provide support to public-sector service delivery for seeds and livestock breeding and information management. Following sub-components are included:Sub-component 2.1: Training and capacity building of agri-food clusters. This sub-component would support climate smart training and capacity building of beneficiaries including farmers and processing enterprises, and other participants in the targeted agri-food clusters. This sub-component would also provide training to relevant government agencies for improved services to the producers.Sub-component 2.2: Seed system improvement. This sub-component would support the enabling environment for policies, strategies, legal frameworks, standards, and organizations associated with seed and planting material.Sub-component 2.3: Improved livestock breeding and information management system. This sub-component would support improvement of animal breeding policies and regulations, development of a national dairy breeding plan, artificial insemination services, and strengthening of public services.Component 3: Operational support and project management. This component would support project implementation, including the project’s monitoring and evaluation system, communication strategy, preparation and implementation of environment and social framework instruments, training, and financing of incremental operating costs.Component 4: Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC).

In order to achieve this objective, the following sub-objectives are included: (i) link rural community centers to the nearest main roads to interconnect villages and areas with economic and social potential; (ii) connect rural areas that have become isolated due to geographic reasons or climate impacts; (iii) solve crossing problems in lowland areas that are regularly affected by climate impacts, and (iv) strengthening policy, institutional and strategic frameworks that support the provision of climate resilient rural roads, including strengthening road maintenance management. In addition to the above overarching objectives, the program aims at contributing to other cross-cutting objectives. These include improving road safety, building resilience of the rural road network and of the communities served to natural disasters and climate change impacts, mainstreaming gender, extending the service life of the road assets through best practice asset management practices and sustained maintenance, and deepening institutional reforms in the rural roads sector. The program design has benefited from lessons learned in the implementation of previous rural road programs in the country, including the need for clear delineation of responsibilities, involvement of key stakeholders in the design process, and ensuring adequate capacity for implementation is in place. The program will benefit from foreign and local experiences in the design and implementation of rural road programs by the World Bank and other development partners in other parts of the world including in Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. The Scope of the Program encompasses the following elements: (i) construction and maintenance of climate resilient roads to connect rural kebele centers to the nearest main roads connecting agriculture potential areas; (ii) construction of pedestrian suspension crossings (trail bridges) for areas with lack of access because of topography; (iii) construction of special structures (pipe culverts, box culverts, bridges, etc.) for lowland and pastoralist communities with crossing problems; (iv) improving the strategies and practices for planning, implementation and management of regional and woreda roads incorporating climate risks and resilience considerations; (v) strengthening road asset management; and (vi) enhancing road safety on rural roads with particular consideration to vulnerable road users, including pedestrians. The roads to be financed under the Program are connecting agriculture potential areas to markets, including agri-hub facilities to be constructed under component 2 of the IPF. The total estimated cost of the first phase of the RCAP program is US$ 774.3 M, of which the Bank is proposing to finance US$250 million with the balance coming from the Ministry of Finance Treasury allocations, regional and woreda contributions, and possibly other development partners (yet to be identified). The PforR operations will support the Government of Ethiopia over a period of four years to improve rural road network connectivity, access, safety, climate resilience, and quality of the road network. It will provide vital improvements in the rural road network all over the country, including better access for farm-based communities, rural villages, pastoralist communities to all weather roads that reach market centers and different social and economic centers. This PforR program is planned to cover (32%) of the total financing required for RCAP which will be managed in line with national regulations, under the Government treasury system and maintained or managed by the financial bureaus at Regional and Woreda levels, with oversight and technical support by MoUI and ERA. The Investment Project Financing (IPF) will consist of two Windows which will support the operation’s objectives. Window 1 will develop an E-Market Place Platform. It will support the piloting of a digital market platform designed by the ATI in collaboration with the Ministry of Trade and Regional Integration. The objectives will be to improve market access for small holder farmers by strengthening market information systems, linking farmers and small traders directly with buyers, and providing market related advisory services including climate impacts and response. Window 2 will enable the Ministry of Urban and Infrastructure (MUI) and the Agricultural Transformation Institute (ATI) to manage and coordinate the operation and to provide support to the regions and woredas in the implementation of the Operation. It will provide funding for staff and associated costs for the Federal Project Coordinating Office (FPCO) as well as Regional Project Coordinating Offices (RPCO) based in the 13 regions of the country.

Resilience is defined as “The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions through risk management.” In the context of LLRP II, improving livelihood and climate resilience rests on enhancing the capacity of lowland PAP households, communities, and production systems to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform, or recover from climate shocks in a timely and efficient manner, while (and including by) ensuring the health and regeneration of lowland ecosystems and natural resources. Increases in production and productivity; better access to markets, roads, services, health, education, diversified diets, energy, and sustainable sources of income; and enhanced capacity to manage local resource-related conflicts are expected, among other improvements, to contribute to these outcomes. Annex 1 explains how livelihood and climate resilience will be measured by the project. Component 1: Pastoral Risk Management for Resilience (PRMR) (US$228 million, including US$184 million IDA and US$44 million IFAD)This component will enhance the absorptive and adaptive capacities of PAP communities and their ecosystems by strengthening DRM capacities and developing public infrastructure that supports disaster preparedness and climate resilience.Subcomponent 1.1: Strengthening Lowlands Early Warning and Response System and Climate Information Services (US$9 million, including US$7 million IDA and US$2 million IFAD) This subcomponent will finance activities that relate to strengthening the early warning and response system and CIS in Ethiopia’s lowlands with a focus on ‘last mile connectivity’. This focus will ensure that information and advice about impending climate change-exacerbated hazards (including drought, floods, conflicts, livestock disease outbreaks, higher temperatures, and pest infestations) reach households across PAP areas in a timely fashion. To strengthen the early warning and response system, the project will finance the preparation of Woreda Disaster Risk Profiles (WDRPs). In a process led by the Ethiopian Disaster Risk Management Commission (EDRMC), WDRPs will be prepared using participatory processes involving community representatives and key stakeholders at the woreda level. Experienced international organizations, such as the International Institute for Rural Reconstruction (IIRR), will facilitate the process and prepare a report using an interactive online platform to be hosted by the EDRMC. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), through the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) Project, will support the integration of climate information into WDRPs. The subcomponent will also (a) build the Government’s and community’s awareness of DRM; (b) support the EDRMC in rolling out the new Multi-Hazard, Impact-Based Early Warning and Early Action System (MH-IB-EW-EAS) roadmap for 2023–2030, in the lowlands, including by helping it develop region-specific implementation plans; (c) support the implementation of the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) in the lowlands by the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute (EMI); (d) strengthen partnerships and coordination among the Ministry of Irrigation and Lowlands (MILLs), EDRMC, and EMI, to ensure the successful implementation of the MH-IB-EW-EAS and NFCS in the lowlands; and (e) build the institutional, organizational, and human resource capacity of key stakeholders including the EDRMC and EMI (at the federal, regional, and woreda levels), with a focus on forecasting and last mile communications in the lowlands of Ethiopia. In relation to CIS, the project will build capacities to collect, analyze, process, and disseminate information. Subcomponent 1.2: Implementing Disaster Preparedness and Resilience Investments (US$219 million, including US$177 million IDA and US$42 million IFAD)This subcomponent will support the identification of, and selectively fund, a range of investments in climate-smart public economic infrastructure (PEI), that is, physical infrastructure that can help mitigate the impacts of climate-related (and other) hazards on PAP systems and communities. The identification, selection, planning and implementation of the PEI investments will follow three steps. These are (a) preparation Regional Disaster Preparedness and Resilience-building Strategic Investment Plans (DPRSIPs) for each of the eight project regions, (b) preparation of specific Climate-smart PEI investment plan for LLRP II, which will emanate from the wider DPRSIPs, and (c) implementation of Climate-smart PEI investments. Eligible climate-smart PEI investments to be financed under this subcomponent include the construction, upgrading, or rehabilitation of (i) drought-resilient water resource infrastructure for both human and livestock consumption (such as deep water well, small, and micro-dams), (ii) efficient and innovative small-scale irrigation schemes (up to 500 ha per scheme), (iii) all-weather feeder roads, (iv) cold storage and feed stores, (v) livestock market facilities, (vi) veterinary service facilities, and (vii) wetland and flood management works. The PEI investments will be strategically sited along key migration and trade corridors and water supply infrastructure will be sited with careful consideration of available grazing resources to avoid overgrazing and degradation in their vicinity. Component 2: Integrated Rangeland Management (IRM) (US$64.48 million, including US$52.16 million IDA and US$12.32 million IFAD)Building on the success of LLRP I, the project will continue to use rangelands as the entry point for investments. Component 2 aims to improve the absorptive and adaptive capacities of PAP ecosystems by monitoring and improving the health and productivity of natural rangeland resources (improving their soil stability, hydrologic function, vegetation productivity, and biotic integrity) and attenuate community-level conflict in PAP areas. Healthier and more productive rangelands, in turn, will increase livestock productivity, PAP households’ livelihoods, and PAP systems’ overall resilience. They will also increase above- and below-ground soil carbon stocks, contributing to climate change mitigation and resilience. To achieve these results, the component will apply integrated, participatory, nature-based, and climate-smart approaches and leverage renewable and efficient energy sources and technologies. It will also leverage selected research outputs and innovations generated by ILRI’s AICCRA Project on feed, pasture management, and integrated rangeland management in the lowlands. When possible, the project will promote NBS with guidance from the World Bank’s NBS Invest Program. The component will have three subcomponents. Subcomponent 2.1: Rangeland Health Monitoring and Institutional Capacity Building (US$4.35 million, including US$3.48 million IDA and US$0.87 million IFAD)The subcomponent will support (a) the establishment of a national rangeland monitoring system (RMS) and (b) rangeland monitoring and management institutions, proactively targeting women in capacity-building efforts. Subcomponent 2.2: Participatory Rangeland and Pasture Management (PRPM) (US$52.5 million, including US$42.5 million IDA and US$10.0 million IFAD)This subcomponent will support (a) the preparation of rangeland management plans (RMPs), (b) the implementation of rangeland and pasture development activities, and (c) the production and marketing of forage and feed. of fodder and feed production in PAP areas.

The most affected are the poor and over 70 percent of the population living in rural areas who depend on crop and livestock production for their livelihoods. The percentage of food insecure people doubled from 2015 to 2020/21, and the percentage of people facing acute food insecurity has remained between 40 to 50 percent of the total population. The food security situation is further endangered by recent emerging key risks, recent earthquake in Herat Province, Moroccan locust outbreak affecting crop production, the recent outbreak of animal diseases, and the uncertain future of the Black Sea Grain Deal. In this context, it is important to continue emergency response support to secure food production in highly food insecure areas and prevent further crisis. At the same time, to address the drivers of food insecurity related to climate change and to build resilience, the uptake of climate adaptation measures, and strategies to expand sustainable rural livelihood opportunities is essential.This additional financing will provide an additional US$100 Million to the Emergency Food Security Project to support resilience of production systems by (i) enhancing the availability of improved and climate-resilient production inputs and training, (ii) promoting access to improved irrigation facilities and water management practices which will improve water security for agriculture and (iii) providing resilience building support in watersheds through promoting agroforestry, erosion control facilities, which will ensure availability of water and resilience of landscapes e.g. through reduced degradation, erosion, or improved soil health, in the context of climate change. These measures will increase and stabilize production of wheat and support the diversification to horticulture production of targeted beneficiaries, which will enhance access to nutritious food and diversification of income sources. Production systems will become robust to economic, social, and environmental shocks, including climate shocks with an increased capacity to adapt to shocks.

This road corridor to be rehabilitated has been prioritized for its contribution to market access and overall food security. Key revisions to the parent project will include: (i) changes in project costs and modification of activities; and (ii) changes in the results framework. The AF will deploy additional credits in the amount of US$76 million from IDA, an additional grant in the amount of US$9.0 million from the Liberia Reconstruction Trust Fund, and a counterpart funding of US$8 million to finance a specific 10 km road rehabilitation.By upgrading from unpaved to paved road, this proposed AF is transformative in adapting Liberia’s road network to increased climate change risk which is a threat to connectivity and food security across the country. With the paved surface and other resilient designs, the proposed road is expected to remain passable throughout the year and withstand potential heavy rainfall and flooding.The 75 km road from Toe-Town to Zwedru and the 10 km road from Toe-Town to the Ivory Coast border under this proposed additional financing will complement the achievement and the on-going activities financed by the WB in Liberia: (i) 248 km road corridor improvement from Monrovia to Ganta and the Guinea border (LIBRAMP – P125574); (ii) 100 km Southeastern road corridor improvement from Ganta to Saglepie and Tappita (SECRAMP – P149279); and (iii) 40 km Southeastern road corridor improvement from Tappita to Toe-Town (parent project).

The AF scale-up activities will focus mainly on financing: (i) the construction of an additional 85 km road of which 75 km is on the Southeastern corridor; (ii) climate-resilient spot improvements to feeder roads leading to the corridor; (iii) the related monitoring, E&S, and climate adaptation consultancy services ; (iv) the associated Human Resources operating costs; (v) a cost overrun / funding gap of US$5.25 million on the 40 km road from Tappita to Toe-Town under the parent project; and (vi) a contingency for resettlement and physical / price adjustment.The 85 km road includes 75 km segment from Toetown to Zwedru on the Southeastern corridor and a 10 km spur connecting the Southeastern Corridor to the Ivory Coast border . This road section links the southeastern part of Liberia, where about a third of its population dwells, to the capital city of Monrovia as well as the Freeport of Monrovia. This investment is key to providing an economic lifeline for inaccessible rural areas that are strongly vulnerable to climate change impacts and with high incidence of poverty. It will also support the economic integration of the region with the rest of Liberia and neighboring countries and foster regional trade with Cote d’Ivoire and Guinea. In addition, the construction of this segment to an all-weather standard by closing a critical gap in road connectivity that constrains market access and agricultural production in Nimba County will contribute to improvement in market access, reduce logistical cost, reduce post-harvest losses, boost agricultural sector competitiveness, and improve rural livelihoods and food security.The road will be constructed under a design-build approach based on an existing conceptual design. Works will include full construction of a climate-resilient two-lane carriageway (3.75-meter-wide lanes and 1.5-meter paved shoulders) with bituminous surfacing along the existing right-of-way, with associated drainage structures, and road furniture. In the urbanized zones, the road section will have 1.5-meter-wide block paved pedestrian walkways on both sides with climate-resilient features, wide concrete side drains to accommodate heavy precipitation, and disability inclusive access as required. The works will also provide several cross-drainage structures, culverts, and bridges over streams and rivers. The pavement will have a 20-year design life.

Subcomponent 1.1: Upgrading Food Crisis Prevention and Monitoring Systems – US$1.5 million GAFSP. The AF will include a new activity to support the FNS through support to government departments responsible for agricultural statistics and monitoring and evaluation to carry out relevant surveys nationwide and provide technical assistance to improve the collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination of data. The AF will scale-up activities under Component 1 of the parent project to strengthen risk detection mechanisms to ensure effective preparedness and timely response while strengthening the country’s resilience to climate shocks. It will also scale up activities of the parent project which strengthen the existing collaboration between the national institutions working on early warning and CILSS. Finally, it will finance a Food Crisis Preparedness and Response Plan to strengthen disaster preparedness at community level and cover all the costs associated with increased data collection and processing, including the completion of field-level surveys linked to the Cadre Harmonise. Component 2: Sustainability and Adaptive Capacity of the Food System’s Productive Base (US$ 15.0 million). The AF will scale up existing interventions linked to the parent project while placing additional emphasis on improving nutrition outcomes. Subcomponent 2.1: Consolidate Regional Agricultural Innovation System - AF US$ 2.0 million GAFSP. The AF will scale-up research, innovation and extension services promoted under the parent project to invest in: i) equipment and knowledge related to vegetable farming in close collaboration with the National Center of Specialization in Fruits and Vegetables Burkina Faso; and ii) increased adoption of climate-smart practices and nutrition education- with a particular focus on youth and women. Climate-smart agriculture and nutrition education: To promote the adoption of climate-smart, gender- and nutrition-sensitive technologies in the targeted value chains, 400 extension workers8 will be trained in CSA practices and nutrition-smart agriculture, with an aim to specifically include women who are traditionally excluded from extension education. Following these trainings, they will be supported to establish farmer field schools and train farmers for the adoption of improved technologies. To foster gender-responsive nutrition education on the requirements of a safe, healthy, and diverse diet, the AF will build the capacity of 300 female trainers selected from the National Network of Women Farmers of Togo in the fields of food processing, storage (including to reduce risks of aflatoxin contamination), nutrition and food hygiene. Once trained, the women will establish a network of trainers who will replicate the training within their communities. Subcomponent 2.2: Strengthening Regional Food Security through Integrated Landscape Management (US$ 13.0 million). Under this sub-component, the AF will scale up existing activities to promote producers’ access to high quality inputs with a special focus on crops with high nutritional value and with special considerations for women, given that women frequently lack access to quality inputs. It will also add two new activities to support: i) households in the acquisition of improved breeds (poultry and small ruminants); ii) animal health; and iii) increased production and use of organic fertilizers and biopesticides. Vegetable production: To promote vegetable production, the AF will provide support to 2,600 producers (at least 60 percent of whom will be women) at a total of 60 sites to i) set up small-scale irrigation systems; and ii) access output markets. More specifically, the AF will support producers with irrigation kits based on solar pumping systems and support the drilling of the corresponding wells. These activities will focus on women, who traditionally lack access to agricultural assets. In addition, the AF will finance training sessions for women and youth on market access, and climate-resilient land management practices related to vegetable production and nutrition-smart agriculture under the responsibility of National Extension Agency, the Institute for Advice and Technical Support (ICAT). The trainings will be based on the establishment of supervised field schools or production plots using the farmer business school approach. In addition, nutrition education classes will be provided to producers. About 400 young people (40 percent women) will receive training on the maintenance of small irrigation infrastructure and equipment, facilitated through matching grants. Scale-up production of high nutritional value crops: To foster the production of crops with high nutritional value (orange-fleshed sweet potato, moringa, biofortified maize, cowpea and soybeans) and the increased use of organic fertilizers, 71,000 vulnerable producers, including 20,000 rice producers (60 percent women), 15,000 corn producers (40 percent women), 1,000 soybean producers (40 percent women), 20,000 market gardeners (60 percent women) and 15,000 cowpea producers (40 percent women) will be identified and supported with kits made up of subsidized seeds, fertilizers and biofertilizers. These kits will contribute to reducing gender gaps related to the use of agricultural inputs considering that female producers generally lack access to inputs. Seeds for food crops will be purchased primarily from the national network of certified seed producers in Togo (RNPSC-T)9. The kits will be distributed in accordance with arrangements put in place by the GoT as part of the inputs for grain program led by Togo's National Food Security Agency (ANSAT). Inputs will be delivered through a credit-based system where beneficiaries will receive inputs at the beginning of the planting season and pay back for the inputs in kind upon harvest. ANSAT will collect harvested products equivalent to the value of the inputs supplied to operate a revolving fund. This scheme facilitating access to inputs has already been implemented during past farming seasons with satisfactory results. It is being scaled up during the ongoing 2023-2024 farming season with the support of the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), the Kara agropole, the Food Crisis Response and Emergency Support Programme in Togo (PRCASUT) funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB) as well as the Project to Strengthen Food Systems for Sustainable Access to Agricultural Inputs for Small Producers (Pro-SADI) funded by the European Union and implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP). If feasible, the production of other drought resilient crops such as millet will also be supported. New activities on animal breeds and health: To improve livestock productivity and harness additional income generating opportunities, the AF will provide support for 2,000 beneficiaries (40 percent female) in acquiring improved livestock breeds and in improving animal health (vaccination campaigns for poultry and small ruminants) and animal shelter.10 Beneficiary households will be provided with about 800 poultry and 1200 small ruminants. To improve animal health in targeted areas for the benefit of a total of 4,000 farmers (40 percent female), including 2,000 who have received improved livestock breeds, the AF will acquire vaccines and carry out vaccination campaigns.

The Addis-Djibouti corridor, which accounts for 95 percent of the country’s import-export trade volumes is the main artery that serves the critical function of connecting landlocked Ethiopia to the seaEthiopia is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa that shares six borders with Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, and Sudan. In October 2019, the geographic, economic and historical ties led these countries to form the Horn of Africa Initiative (HoAI) with the aim of fostering regional, coordinated and concerted action among the countries to face common development challenges hampering economic growth and poverty eradication. The proposed Ethiopia HOA-Regional Economic Corridor Project (HoA-RECORD) is the third in a Series of Projects (SoP) under the HoAI transport pillar. The proposed project has three components:1: Safe, Smart, Efficient and Resilient Road Corridor Construction: Construction of the Mieso – Dire Dawa road section on the Ethiopia – Djibouti regional corridor (estimate of preferred route 142km) as a safe, smart, efficient and resilient corridor which is designed as a 4-lane fenced and tolled expressway with a 90m roadway reserve width. The road crosses Oromia, Afar, Amhara, Somali and Dire Dawa Regional States. 2: Trade and Logistics Enhancement: Trade facilitation and logistics enhancement including the hard and soft measures and interventions to reduce both tariff and non-tariff barriers in the movement of goods and people not only on the road corridor but on other important trade corridors in the country. The Project will complement existing interventions by financing : (a) Construction and refurbishment of one stop border posts, (b) Construction and refurbishment of dry ports (c) Trade policy, procedures, regulations harmonization and implementation between Ethiopia and immediate HoA neighbors; (d) support to women and youth traders affected by improved efficiency suffering income loss due to the project.3: Localized Complementary Infrastructure and Interventions: As part of an inclusive design to ensure that the people in the areas where the road corridor passes also benefit from the investment, as well as in an effort to maximize the local and wider economic benefits of the project, complementary infrastructures and interventions are proposed. The final interventions will be decided based on needs assessments and a prioritization scheme ensuring sustainability and inclusiveness in targeting, subproject selection, subproject implementation, and operations planning; potentially including: (a) Provision of link and access roads to woredas, farms, markets, livestock, abattoir, dairy farms, and important industrial sites in the project corridor area of influence; (b) Provision of simple road-side auxiliary markets with provision of girl/women friendly amenities; (c) Provision of localized logistics infrastructure in the areas crossed by the road corridor including drying, sorting, , grading, packaging, collection, buying, selling, storage, consolidation centers.4: Institutional Development and Project Monitoring: Institutional development and capacity building interventions to support the implementing agencies in the achievement of project objectives, and to further corporate agendas like gender, climate change, jobs, inclusion and citizen engagement as well as continue the support to strengthening ERA’s environmental and social management, and other transport agendas under the Ministry of Transport e.g. railway sector and road safety reforms.

This modest economic growth has been insufficient to reduce poverty and Honduras remains the third poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean region. The rural poor rely largely on low-productivity agricultural activities for income, have limited access to basic services, and are highly vulnerable to natural and macroeconomic shocks. Around 70 percent of indigenous populations live in poverty and female labor force participation in Honduras (52 percent) is far lower than the male rate (86 percent).The agri-food sector is one of the key pillars driving the Honduran economic performance. The agriculture sector accounted for 12 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018, further expanded to around 23 percent when considering the backward and forward linkages with other sectors. The sector provides 30 percent of the country’s labor force. However, sectorial performance is undermined by low productivity and value addition, vulnerability to climate change, low technical and managerial capacity to start and develop agribusiness, limited access to financial services and to farm and organizational innovations, weak public sector institutional capacity to provide key services and improve the agribusiness enabling environment, insecurity over land ownership and food security issues. The sector is mostly composed of small-scale productive systems (92 percent), formed by family farmers, whose operations are characterized by low scale, productivity and competitiveness, low levels of organization and income generation, and high vulnerability to climate and internal market shocks. Parent Project The parent project COMRURAL III will contribute to economic recovery of smallholder family farmers by improving competitiveness, resilience and innovation in prioritized value chains, towards a more sustainable agri-food system. The design is based on turning the crises into an opportunity to build-back better the national agri-food system and prevent further nutritional and food security deteriorations. Competitiveness will be driven by environmentally friendly and inclusive investments in productive alliances to improve the ability of family farmers to increase productivity and value addition to successfully compete in the markets by meeting customers’ demands for price, quality, and quantity of products. The project will focus on supporting smallholder family farmers and their organizations to: (i) identify and prepare agribusiness plans that rely on productive alliances with key technical, commercial, institutional, and financial partners; (ii) improve the human capital in rural producer organizations for leading the transformation of the agri-food system; an d (iii) simplify and modernize the public services that are success factors for the productive alliances. The project will also help creating an immediate demand for jobs in the agribusiness sector as one of the key drivers for the country to restore and strengthen its economic dynamism, to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the crises. The direct beneficiaries will include primarily: (i) households lead by farmers or agri-food entrepreneurs who will participate in the project through the preparation of investment sub-projects, preferably as part of a producers’ group, association or cooperative and (ii) public and private sector institutions and their staff that play a primary role in facilitating and improving the agri-food system’s performance. The proposed project will also have indirect benefits for a much broader range of stakeholders in the agriculture sector through (i) en hancing the overall agriculture sector business environment by modernizing the public entities that provide services to those engaged in the agriculture sector (over 300 thousand families or nearly 1.5 million Hondurans); and (ii) helping improve rural productive infrastructure within the prioritized territories.The parent project is organized in four components:Component 1 will continue promoting the COMRURAL productive alliance model to improve the competitiveness, resilience, and inclusion or family farmers and their organizations within strategic value chains and to mobilize the co-financing of these investments by private financial institutions. The participatory design and implementation of the subprojects (business plans) will be supported with technical assistance for agribusiness development and a matching grant scheme to unlock the provision of co-financing from private financial institutions. Subprojects will be identified and selected through a demand-driven and transparent mechanism that will ensure the participation and inclusion of women, indigenous people and afro descendants, and the prioritization of climate-smart and nutrition-smart innovations, as well as farm and agrologistics innovations to boost productivity, value addition, food processing and bio-sanitary and safety procedures, food and nutrition security, and digitalization of agriculture.Component 2 will help improve the enabling environment of agribusinesses by supporting the modernization and strengthening of selected public sector services that are key to improve the performance and competitiveness of agribusiness in agri-food system of Honduras. The component will support this type of improvements in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG), National Service for Agri-food Health and Safety (SENASA), the Sanitary Regulation Agency (ARSA), amongst others.Component 3 will finance the overall project management including: (i) project management and coordination among different stakeholders; (ii) project monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment; (iii) project fiduciary administration, internal controls, and audits; (iv) project environmental and social risk/safeguards management; (v) a citizen’s engagement mechanism; and (vi) project-related studies. Component 4 will be a Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) that will provide for an immediate response to eligible emergencies. In the event of such an emergency (the mechanism for declaration of an eligible emergency would be agreed between the World Bank and the Government of Honduras), this component will finance emergency activities and expenditures through the reallocation of funds from the project.Proposed Additional Financing: The GoH requested financing from GAFSP in order to respond to the urgent need for improving food security in the AF target region, Moskitia-Costa Atlantica due to long standing development challenges and recent weather shocks. The region was severely affected by Tropical Storm Julia in October 2022 and in a rapid assessment conducted the same month, more than 20 percent of the inhabitants in Gracias a Dios, equivalent to 24,000 people, were found to be facing serious livelihood and food security challenges due to the severe effects of the storm . Above-average levels of rainfall have also had devastating consequences and exacerbated pre-existing multi-sectoral needs throughout the country, and Moskitia-Costa Atlantica was one of the hardest-hit. Excess rainfall has caused significant crop loss, with nearly 25,000 hectares of crops affected, causing food shortages and price surges. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) projections for June to August 2022 found the Moskitia-Costa Atlantica region faced the highest severity of crisis-level food insecurity (45 percent) of the country’s eighteen departments.In March 2023, GAFSP awarded US$8.5 million to the GoH to respond to the food security crisis in La Moskitia.

The country has experienced rapid demographic growth, its population having expanded by 65 percent (12 million people) or 3.3 percent per year on average since 2000. But economic opportunity has grown even faster, with high prices for cash crops, oil, and gold contributing to an average GDP growth rate of 5.8 percent per year over the same period. As a result, in the space of two decades, Ghana doubled its per capita income and went from over half to less than a quarter of its population living with less than $2.15 a day. This achievement made it the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving extreme poverty by 2015. In 2017, Ghana was the second-fastest growing economy in Africa with a growth rate of 8.1 percent, driven by the mining and oil sectors. To further mitigate poverty and inequality and accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the country has launched ambitious plans to diversify and grow the economy by modernizing agriculture and accelerating industrialization. These are among the objectives of the Medium-Term Development Plan for 2018–2021 and the Government of Ghana’s (GoG’s) “Ghana Beyond Aid” reform agenda. Ghana’s economy is urbanizing, yet agriculture has been, and remains, a pillar of the country’s economic progress accounting for one-fifth of Ghana’s GDP and employ one-fifth of its workforce. The tree crops sector has played a prominent role in driving economic growth and export earnings by both agricultural and national standards. For instance, Ghana is the second largest global producer of cocoa in the world, having generated 14 percent of the global supply in 2020. It is also a minor supplier of half a dozen of other tree crops including cashew nuts (2 percent of global supply in 2020), coconuts, oil palm fruit, natural rubber (each <1 percent but among the top-20), mangos (<1 percent, ranked 36th), and sheanuts (4.5%, ranked 5th). However, agriculture sector is predominantly informal and dominated by smallholder farmers and family farms, relying on traditional farming methods, which makes it a high-risk sector for child labor (ILO and CEIS, 2017). For example, most children involved in cocoa production work as unpaid family labor, which is a direct result of the smallholder production structure of the cocoa sector in Ghana (ILO and CEIS, 2017). Growth in the agriculture sector over the last decade has not been environmentally and socially sustainable. While there has been an increase in number of cocoa growing households as a proportion of all agricultural households, from 55% to 86% between 2008/09 and 2018/19, mirroring an increase in production, there was also a simultaneous increase in the prevalence rate of child labor (11% increase) and hazardous child labor (8% increase) in cocoa production (ILO and CEIS 2017). It is thought that most of the growth in child labor and hazardous child labor has taken place due to increase in production that led to expansion into new less saturated geographic areas and due to the increased use of agro-chemicals in cocoa production practices (NORC, 2020).The proposed project will have 4 components as follows:Component 1: Institutional strengthening and value chain governance (US$ 25 million). This component will build capacity of Tree Crop Development Authority (TCDA) and Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), as well as the capacity to improve the business enabling environment for socially and environmentally sustainable farming and agribusinesses in the selected value chains (cocoa, cashew nuts and coconut). Investments under this component will support the design and implementation of policies and regulations that aim to strengthen effectiveness, social and environmental sustainability of the selected tree crops’ value chains, support research and development (R&D) to underpin climate resilient production, and digitize the value chains for traceability, and mainstream national capacity to monitor and prevent child labor. The component will have 3 subcomponents: (a) Subcomponent 1.1. Institutional capacity, policies, and regulations will finance TCDA to build institutional capacity and improve service delivery vis-a-vis the private sector. This will include carrying out a needs assessment, offering training, developing administrative policies and manuals for internal operations (HR, IT, internal audit, finance, and procurement), personnel support, and creating an agribusiness promotion desk. It also includes strengthening the governance of the cashew council and coconut federation – TCDA’s service interlocutors – to facilitate and promote effective private sector nurseries, input providers and other service delivery. The project will also support TCDA to implement a new 2022 tree crop regulations, and modifications to other existing policies and regulations, including mainstreaming climate change. Both COCOBOD and TCDA will do consultations and analysis to better understand the impacts of specific policies and regulations on farmers, processors, enterprise owners, and other value chain actors. Their findings will inform the design of new policies and regulations, as well as advocacy efforts relating to existing regulations. This subcomponent will also strengthen the institutional capacity of the stakeholders with legal mandate to coordinate action against child labor and respond to child labor cases, namely the Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations (MELR) and the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP). These ministries will be strengthened in their statutory oversight, coordination, planning, and monitoring role with respect to child labor, particularily to complement COCOBOD and TCDA’s social risk management systems through leveraging ongoing prevention and remediation programs, professionals and services managed and overseen by these ministries. Particular attention will be given to strengthening child labor monitoring as a contribution to the management information systems that are being developed to ensure product traceability; (b) Sub-component 1.2. Demand-driven research will finance COCOBOD and Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) to integrate cutting edge technology into research programs. relating to cocoa. Priority topics will include Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD), fungal diseases, and cocoa pests, as well as fertilizer-use efficiency, natural cocoa pollination, and the development of shade tree varieties. Among other things, the project will support the creation of a CSSVD lab. The project will also finance TCDA and the Center for Scientific and Industrial Research, Oil Palm Research Institute (CSIR-OPRI) and the CSIR Crop Research Institute (CSIR-CRI), responsible for coconut and cashew research respectively, to develop cutting edge research. The program will focus on developing and disseminating appropriate plant varieties with tolerance that is suitable for different geographical regions, including in highly disease prone areas. The project will also finance, TCDA to set up an in vitro lab for cashew and coconut, and breeding programs that develop these high-yielding, pest- and disease-resistant, and climate-resilient tree crop varieties. The project will also support the dissemination of research and technology on farms, as well as proven approaches like integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest and disease management (IPDM)(c) Sub-component 1.3. Value chain digitization for traceability and revenue mobilization. For cashew and coconut, the project will finance the TCDA in implementing an existing blueprint for digitizing the value chains it oversees. For cocoa, the sub-component will support COCOBOD’s “last mile” roll-out of the Cocoa Management System (CMS) in project areas and train staff to monitor syst",[],[],[],[],[],"['breeding', 'fertility', 'smallholder']","['breeding', 'fertility', 'smallholder']"

Following a major security crisis in 2013 that displaced over 25 percent of its 4.9 million people, CAR has embarked on a long recovery process. However, despite the signing of a peace agreement in 2019, conflicts and violence continue to affect the country’s economic performance. Average GDP growth has been low and not inclusive over the past decades. Poverty remains pervasive with an estimated 71 percent of the population living below the international poverty line (US$ 1.90 per day, 2011 PPP) in 2019. The Central African Republic (CAR) continue to face severe food crisis with over 52 percent of the population undernourished, and the COVID-19 pandemic, global food shortages, rising fuel prices, and other import costs are worsening the crisis. The country ranks 120th out of 121 countries on the Global Hunger Index. The crisis is leading to a rise in malnutrition rates and difficulties in accessing enough food, resulting in one of the highest under-five mortality rates in 2021. The crisis is affecting the country's economy as agriculture is a major source of income and employment, and it is projected that the ongoing food insecurity will exacerbate the already high poverty rate.As per the last Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, during the current period of review (September 2022 to March 2023), 2.7 million people (41 percent of the analyzed population) face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Nearly 3 million people (49 percent of the analyzed population) are expected to be in high acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) in the April to August 2023 period. This represents a net increase of nearly 300,000 additional people being in IPC3+ in less than one year. By August 2023, the majority of the country's regions are expected to be in either a crisis (IPC3) or emergency (IPC4) state, with regions previously in IPC3 projected to worsen.The proposed Additional financing to the Emergency Food Crisis response is well aligned with the World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) in CAR for FY21–25, as well as with the WBG FCV Strategy. CAR is one of the most fragile countries in the world, where the risk of recurrence of conflict is higher if the level of food insecurity is high. Indeed, improved food security will help mitigate some of the spillovers of long years of conflict in the country.The project will be implemented through four components:Component 1: This component will support an accelerated supply response focused on restoring and preserving the productive capacity of farming households to enable continued and expanded production of key staple foods and livestock that is resilient to climate change. It will be have three sub-components:Subcomponent 1.1: Support food production and household nutrition Subcomponent 1.2: Support to seed protection and linkages to market opportunities Subcomponent 1.3: Strengthening hydro-meteorological information for early warning Component 2: Labor-intensive public works for resilience will finance livelihood support programs through labor-intensive public works (LIPW) in six prefectures and in Bangui. The LIPW will provide short-term relief to food-insecure households through cash-for-work activities, while at the same time fostering adaptation to climate change and enhanced resilience to flooding.

Activities will focus on the Caribbean coast region of Nicaragua which includes some of the areas heavily affected by hurricanes Eta,Iota and Julia that caused extensive damage to agricultural production in the same areas,. The Project area has been defined as those areas suffering from the compound impacts of the hurricanes in the North Caribbean Autonomous Region (Region Autonoma de la Costa Caribe Norte - RACCN) and South Caribbean Autonomous Region (Region Autonoma de la Costa Caribe Sur - RACCS) as defined in the Project Operations Manual (POM). With the AF, the Project has three components:Component 1: Recovery, rehabilitation, and resilient reconstruction (US$69 million) Subcomponent 1.1: Emergency disaster recovery (US$1.6 million) Under this subcomponent the Project supports response to damages caused by hurricane Julia in 2022 and future similar events (as per the latest restructuring). Activities supported under the subcomponent include, among others, minor repair works, provision of construction materials, and technical assistance to affected communities.Subcomponent 1.2: Rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected critical infrastructure (US$30 million)During disasters, the continued operation of critical public infrastructure is key to efficient response and recovery. A significant number of roads, bridges, and public buildings were heavily damaged and/or destroyed after the passage of Eta and Iota. This subcomponent is financing the rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected critical infrastructure, including (a) conducting any necessary engineering assessments for these works; (b) supporting demolition and debris removal, as applicable; (c) taking measures to restore critical services and use of selected critical Infrastructure, as needed; and (d) preparing the technical specifications and acquiring the necessary equipment to resume the provision of critical public services. The Project will support investments that (a) maximize climate co-benefits; and (b) are resistant to climate-induced events such as floods, storm surges, and landslides by using design standards that increase asset resilience to higher hazard intensity levels (including the enforcing of building code legislation or updating its provisions, when necessary). Where relevant, selected investments will include appropriate energy efficiency measures. Detailed climate-resilient and inclusive design criteria are included in the POM.Subcomponent 1.3: Rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected resilient housing and community-level social infrastructure (US$37.4 million)The resilient recovery of housing and community-level social infrastructure for those affected by the hurricanes is a priority-need for the affected populations. This subcomponent is financing the rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected housing units and community-level social infrastructure in the Project area to make them safer and culturally appropriate, including, inter alia: (a) conducting required engineering assessments and designs; (b) supporting demolition and debris removal; and (c) taking measures to restore critical services and usage of said selected structures. Housing reconstruction will consider the specific and various needs of the population, traditional designs, the application of construction standards, and current and future safety conditions. It will draw on experiences from the recovery and reconstruction process after hurricane Felix. The works under this subcomponent will be complemented by functional upgrades and climate-resistant designs, including energy efficiency features where relevant, enforcing building code legislation to increase the resilience of the housing to climate-related risks.Component 2: Livelihood recovery (US$24.25 million)The AF will add to Component 2 a new subcomponent on Agri-food LIDPs after which Component 2 will consist of the following two subcomponents:(Subcomponent 2.1: Local Innovation Development Plans for Livelihood Recovery in the Artisanal Fishing Sector (US$10 million already being implemented by the parent Project). Currently under implementation, it focuses on restoring the livelihoods in the subsistence artisanal fishing sector by providing fishing equipment, supplies and training. Beneficiaries are selected based on existing LIDPs that were designed for informal and formal groups of small-scale fishermen to benefit from the GAFSP-funded PAIPSAN Project (2015-2019) and other criteria as detailed in the Project Operational Manual (POM). Beneficiaries are prioritized based on participatory approaches with affected populations as described in the parent Project’s Environmental and Social (E&S) instruments.Subcomponent 2.2 (New): Agri-food Local Innovation Development Plans for Enhancing Food and Nutrition Security (US$14.25 million from the AF Project). This is the main additional activity of the AF, and will enhance the productive and marketing capacities of family farmers (subsistence agriculture; commercial agriculture) and small-scale rural agribusiness by (a) providing technical assistance (consultancy services, goods, training, non-consultancy services, operational costs) to support the participatory (demand-driven) identification and design of climate and nutrition-smart agri-food LIDPs; and (b) grants to finance their implementation (goods, consultancy services, non-consultancy services, small works, training, and operational costs) alongside the beneficiaries. The agri-food LIDPs will support formal and informal groups of beneficiaries (i.e., cooperatives, producers' associations, farmers groups, women farmer groups, small-scale young agri-entrepreneurs, indigenous communities, afro descendants) to achieve improvements and innovations in production and processing and consolidate market opportunities. The grants will range approximately between US$1,250 and US$2,000 per beneficiary, while the beneficiaries will contribute with in-kind counterpart funding.Component 3: Monitoring, evaluation, and audit of the Project (US$1.75 million)The AF will be used to add an amount of US$0.75 million to track the new indicators introduced by the AF Project and expand the audit to also cover the AF Project. Scaling up of ongoing activities will include (a) expanding the audit of the Project; and (b) expanding the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities of the Project, including, inter alia, the development of baselines as needed to measure project results, a final evaluation of the Project, rapid impact assessments, technical audits, and independent inspections.",[],[],[],[],[],['processing'],['processing']

The eligibility criteria include having: (a) an ADSDPP; (b) a CADT; and (c) at least one IPO recognized by NCIP and registered with an accredited government institution. At pre-appraisal, out of the 135 ADs in Mindanao (excluding BARMM ), 52 meet these eligibility criteria. The implementation readiness criteria to ensure that ADs are willing and have the capacity to participate in the project are: (a) the AD is not classified by the government as an active conflict area ; and (b) the responsible LGUs have provided a resolution confirming their support for MIADP. Based on implementation readiness criteria and a first-come-first-serve basis, out of the 52 ADs who meet the eligibility criteria, the project expects to provide support to about 26 ADs, with an indicative goal of 3 to 5 ADs in each of Mindanao’s five regions and 1 to 3 ADs in BARMM, considering the time frame required for IPO strengthening, formulation of the ADAIF, preparation of enterprise and infrastructure concept notes/proposals, subproject design and implementation, and available budget , among others. These factors will be reviewed as the project proceeds. For project start-up, 10 ADs have been identified as having met the Implementation Readiness Criteria. They encompass two ADs in each of Regions 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 in Mindanao. The project will expand the current and very limited knowledge base of gender gaps in agriculture in the target ADs. The lack of basic information and data on IPs in the Philippines is perennially acknowledged, even with more than 20 years since the IPRA was passed . Not surprisingly, it is even more difficult to obtain data and information on the gender dimension of agriculture and related enterprises in indigenous communities. The project will also seek to increase the participation of indigenous women in the IPOs’ preparation and implementation of agro-enterprise subprojects. Initial targets for “increased female participation” and “women-led Business Plans” were set but this will be revisited based on the baseline data collected during the social preparation activities. The project will support a range of climate adaptation and mitigation measures expected to generate significant climate co-benefits. It will contribute to developing a more climate- and disaster-resilient agricultural sector, which is a priority of the National Climate Change Action Plan 2011–28. Climate-smart agricultural and fishery technologies, such as improved varieties, cultural practices, and irrigation that provide resilience to the impacts of extreme weather and the resulting pest and disease outbreaks, will be introduced to IP producer groups. Infrastructure will be built to climate-proof standards.The project has four interlinked components and will follow a phased approach to allow ‘learning-by-doing’. This approach is vital given the importance of a participatory approach for project planning and decision-making, and considering the limited data available for ADs. The first year of implementation will focus on the social preparation, consultation, planning, and institutional strengthening activities for a first batch of around 10 ADs across the various Mindanao Regions (excluding BARMM) under Component 1. It was not possible to complete the collection of baseline data prior to appraisal due to travel constraints during the pandemic, especially in the remote ADs. Therefore, the first year’s activities will include baseline data collection. Based on these preparatory activities, infrastructure (Component 2) and enterprise development (Component 3) subprojects would be prioritized. From the second year onwards, LGUs and IPOs in the first batch of ADs will implement their subprojects, while the preparatory activities for LGUs and IPOs in the second batch of ADs will begin (including BARMM). The infrastructure subprojects would be designed to complement enterprise subprojects through investments in small scale irrigation, improved market access, post-harvest storage and handling facilities. Annex 2 provides details on the project design, and Annex 3 describes the project’s environmental and social risk management. Component 1: Ancestral Domain Planning and Social Preparation. (US$12.5 million of which IBRD is US$10 million). This component will lay the groundwork for the project by supporting social preparation, data collection, science-based planning, and institutional strengthening activities. It will finance: (a) preparation and implementation of a communication plan, awareness-raising events, organizational and capacity-building workshops, and market orientation training for IPs and their organizations that include information sharing on climate risks, feasible CSA options, and existing climate information systems; (b) capacity building, including on climate-smart value chain development through learning modules on the science-based design of adaptation and mitigation measures for climate-resilient agriculture, for LGUs and service providers that support Components 2 and 3; (c) baseline data collection and development of an ADAIF that identifies appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures such as climate-resilient rural infrastructure, and CSA practices (i.e., use of drought-tolerant varieties, greenhouses, crop diversification, integrated pest management, drip irrigation, construction of rain shelters, use of energy-efficient equipment); (d) value chain analyses taking into account environmental suitability and climate-risk vulnerability; (e) facilitation to form and register IPOs and develop alliances with cooperatives, businesses, and NGOs outside the ADs; and (f) technical support on research, capacity-building, and coordination activities with modules on climate-smart agriculture (CSA), etc. to better understand climate risks and design appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures for stronger science-based and market-led inputs to the ADAIFs and business plans of IPO enterprises. Each ADAIF is formulated and validated with full participation of the IPS as the highest governing body. ADAIF and Subproject Concept Proposals would be prepared which will serve as the basis for the investments in Components 2 and 3.Component 2: Resilient Ancestral Domain Agri-Fisheries Infrastructure.

All these elements of project design have a great potential for peacebuilding in many parts of the conflict zones. The design of the project is also based on the nexus between natural resources degradation, climate change impacts, and social conflicts. In this context, implementing the Landscape Restoration Approach is required to face these challenges and break the current deadlock. This approach is recognized as an effective mitigation strategy by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and several experts due to its multiple adaptation and mitigation effects. The project-proposed landscape restoration activities contribute to achieving Mali’s commitments under the Land Degradation Neutrality and NDC. Since in Mali, communes’ territories are linked to specific socio-cultural-linguistic groups and ecosystems, it was agreed to consider the landscape unit equivalent to the commune territory. The Development Objective of the Project is to increase adoption of landscape restoration practices and enhance people’s lives in selected communes.The PDO Level Indicators• Land area under sustainable landscape management practices (CRI, Hectare [Ha])• People with increased benefits from natural resources, disaggregated by sex (Male/female)• Net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CRI, Metric tons CO2/year)• Target beneficiaries with rating “Satisfied” or above on project interventions (disaggregated by sex and age).The project is structured around three interdependent components that help achieve its development objective. Component 1 focuses on strengthening capacities, planning, and conflict prevention strategy. Component 2 focuses on promoting sustainable investment in (a) degraded landscapes to restore their physical and social functions, and (b) improving market access of NTFPs and fishery products through productive alliances. Component 3 focuses on project coordination, communication, and M&E. A fourth Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) is added to immediately respond to a potential crisis following a man-made or natural disaster.The project will preliminary target 87 communes selected based on criteria related to the consolidation / synergy with ongoing Bank projects (mainly PREEFN and PGRNCC); the Malian GGW interventions area; commune poverty profile; and ecosystem vulnerability (see technical background document). Additional communes, including in other regions, may be added using the same criteria.The project is structured around three interdependent components which contribute to achieve the project development objective. A fourth emergency response and contingency component is added to respond immediately to potential crisis following a human-made or natural disaster. Component 1 focuses on strengthening capacities, planning, and communication. Component 2 focuses on promoting sustainable investment (i) in landscapes to restore their physical and social functions including services and resilience capacity and to increase their productivity; and (ii) to enhance local population resilience by improving access of their FNTPs and fishery products to economic opportunities and markets by co-financing investments in Productive Alliances. Component 3 focuses on project coordination and monitoring and evaluation.• Component 1: Institutional support and Capacity Building for Landscape Restoration and Resilience (US$14 million)This component will support initiatives aimed at improving the capacities of all stakeholders in relation to the challenges of landscape development and resilience, improving the knowledge base about landscapes through specific studies, strengthening or updating integrated landscape development and forest and rangeland management plans and share knowledge through an appropriate communication strategy.Sub-component 1.1: Human and Institutional Capacity Strengthening (US$5.5 million)Capacity Strengthening initiatives will aim to: 1.1.1. Support capacity development (US$2 million) of stakeholders involved at national, regional and communal levels, including members of the Project Management Unit (PMU) (US$2 millions). 1.1.2.

The rationale is that conservation and restoration of land and the pursuant efforts to manage that land sustainably can increase soil fertility, fodder, water, and ecosystem services, contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation through carbon sequestration in vegetation and soil, which in turn can increase land, resource, and livestock productivity, and protect biodiversity. Landscape restoration will aim to reconcile economic, social and environmental concerns within a holistic framework, with the best projects utilizing environmental improvements as drivers for socio-economic regeneration . It will enhance and diversify local livelihoods, improve food security, create climate-smart jobs, and increase resilience to the impact of climate change. Sub-component 2.1 Restoring landscapes and ecosystem services (US$70 million)While protecting pastoral and forest landscapes is important, restoring them where they have been lost and degraded is also necessary, necessary because without those landscape, soils, water and the goods and services provided by forests and pastoral resources are lost or impaired. Restoring these landscapes in the fragile and vulnerable context of targeted areas is about much more than returning trees to the landscape. It is about meeting both development and environmental priorities in a context that is primarily rural and predominantly low in terms of human development. Under this sub-component, the project will support restoration of key landscapes of the following ecosystems crossed by the GGWI belt in Mali: 2.1.1 Restoration of the Niger Inner Delta (NID) Landscapes (US$30 million)2.1.2 Restoration of other Landscapes crossed by the by the GGWI belt in Mali (US$30 million)2.1.3: Community integrated Agro-sylvo-pastoral farms (FACI) (US$10 millions)Sub-component 2.2 Improving local livelihoods (US$50 millions)2.2.1 Sustainable development of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) (US$35 millions)2.2.2 Community fishery (US$15 million)2.2.3 Strengthening local social and non-tangible capital of targeted communes (US$2 million)Component 3: Coordination and monitoring-evaluation (US$14 million)This component seeks to provide necessary support for the daily management of the project, and monitoring and evaluation of the field activities.

Conservation of not only the quantity but also the quality of water resources, while managing water-related risks such as floods and droughts, and ensuring resilience to shocks, such as the impact of natural disasters and pandemics such as Covid-19, is essential for strengthening Turkiye’s water security to support long-term growth and sustainability. Demand for water resources in Turkiye from all sectors of the economy has steadily increased in recent decades, with agriculture accounting for 74 percent of freshwater withdrawals, 13 percent for domestic purposes and 13 percent for industry. Irrigation is necessary to ensure resilience of steady agricultural production and food security in Turkiye as only the eastern Black Sea region receives adequate precipitation throughout the year. Spatial and temporal variabilities in temperature and precipitation values hinder year-round production of field and horticultural crops under natural conditions. Irrigation opens possibilities to grow a whole range of crops, boosting wheat, barley, but also corn, sugar, cotton, citrus, grapes and various horticulture crops. Turkiye has extensive irrigation systems, however the efficiency of existing irrigation practices, although gradually being improved, remains a challenge. With over 6 million hectares of irrigated land (more than any other country in the sub-region), a highly sophisticated State Hydraulic Works (DSI), and an emphasis on extending service delivery, Turkey is one of the top irrigation and drainage countries in the world. Yet, it still has widespread low-performing and inefficient irrigation schemes, outdated and obsolete infrastructure, and a limited regulatory framework in support of real water savings. Turkey has set out ambitious goals in its 11th National Development Plan (NDP) and sector Actions Plans to expand and modernize irrigation, increase productivity, and reduce water losses. Apart from floods and droughts, the most important water related risks in Turkiye linked to climate change are significant threats to water quality. Water quality threats stem from a combination of mostly man-made activities such as inadequate wastewater treatment and subsequent effluent discharge, agricultural water pollution, and groundwater depletion leading to salinity and sea water intrusion. Approximately 16 percent of residential wastewater and 38 percent of industrial wastewater is not treated before discharge into water bodies (OECD, 2019). A third of Turkiye’s lakes and up to half of its rivers are currently considered either “contaminated” or “highly contaminated” by nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen. Addressing threats to water quality from the various sources of pollution calls for a holistic approach to water management, including not just investment in improved wastewater collection and treatment, but improving management of wastewater across its value chain with the application of circular economy principles. Ensuring the provision of basic services, such as wastewater services to the unserved population will also be important, not only for promoting public health and wellbeing and reducing water and environmental pollution in selected stressed basins, but also for supporting inclusive development in a post-Covid 19 context.Ensuring Turkiye’s long-term growth and progress towards greener, more resilient, and inclusive development to support a post-Covid-19 recovery will require effective conservation of both the quantity and quality of water resources, and mitigation of water-related risks to strengthen resilience. To address some of the most critical water security challenges identified above, the GoT has prioritized implementation of investments in irrigation modernization, and wastewater treatment with resource recovery and reuse for agriculture in selected water stressed basins through the national budget and has approached the World Bank to support the roll out of selected programs. The proposed project is consistent with the World Bank Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Turkey for the FY 2018-2021 period and is aligned with the objectives of Turkey’s 11th Development Plan (2019–2023). The CPF has three focus areas: (1) Growth; (2) Inclusion; and (3) Sustainability. The project would particularly support Focus Areas 2 and 3. The project will also contribute to Turkiye’s national development goals outlined in its 11th National Development Plan which covers the period of 2019 - 2023. Under the Plan, it is aimed to increase the treated wastewater reuse rate from 1.2 % (in 2018) to 10 % (in 2023). With regards to the irrigation sector, the NDP states that two million hectares of land shall be opened to irrigation over the Plan period. Project Description The project would contribute to addressing existing threats to water security and strengthen resilience to climate change in Turkiye, by supporting the diversification and augmentation of water resources for productive uses, enhancing service delivery efficiency, in particular wastewater and irrigation and drainage services in water stressed and underserved areas, and strengthening management of water resources to better mitigate risks and promote the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. The project will specifically support interventions to: (i) reduce water pollution and environmental degradation, as well as Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from the discharge of untreated wastewaters into receiving water bodies through wastewater treatment, with reuse of treated wastewater in line with a circular economy approach, where economically and technically feasible; (ii) provide access to wastewater treatment services for currently underserved areas; (iii) support the continued rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation investments to reduce losses and enhance energy efficiency; (iv) piloting of novel Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in irrigation management models to enhance efficiency and resilience; and (v) support for water conservation including implementation of regulatory and policy interventions to improve efficiency and demand management; and (vi) technical support to enhance institutional knowledge and innovation and sector capacity for improved water resource management to strengthen resilience. Infrastructure modernization will enhance resilience and climate change mitigation outcomes by prioritizing low energy-intensity and high-water delivery efficiency. The project will have the following components:Component A: Wastewater Collection, Treatment and Reuse. This component seeks to strengthen resilience to increasing climate change-induced water scarcity and to reduce environmental pollution in select water-stressed basins through wastewater treatment, reuse and resource recovery for agricultural irrigation and other beneficial purposes. Subcomponent A1: Construction and Upgrade of Wastewater Collectors and Treatment Plants with Reuse and Resource Recovery Potential. This subcomponent will provide loans to municipalities for consultancy services, goods, and works related to wastewater collection, treatment, reuse and resource recovery infrastructure investments, such as: (a) the extension or rehabilitation of priority raw wastewater collection and conveyance systems; (b) the expansion or upgrade of existing WWTPs with reuse potential; (c) rehabilitation and retrofitting of WWTPs in operation with biogas capture and energy generation facilities and/or sludge treatment processes, allowing for the recovery of these subproducts for reducing energy related operational costs or for other end uses such as agricultural or industrial use; and (d) the installation of treatment processes in existing facilities to",[],[],[],[],[],"['biogas', 'turkey']","['biogas', 'turkey']"

Country Context1. Georgia is an upper-middle-income country with an annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$5,023 in 2021 and a population of about 3.7 million. The country’s economy grew at an average annual rate of nearly 5 percent between 2005 and 2021 despite numerous upheavals, including: the global financial crisis of 2007–08, conflict with the Russian Federation in 2008, the drop in commodity prices since 2014, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In 2021, the economy rebounded strongly (10.4 percent growth), driven by the recovery of consumption and exports. Like other economies in the South Caucasus and Central Asia, Georgia benefited from large inflows of money transfers and people in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on Russia. In 2022, economic growth averaged 10.1 percent. 2. Georgia implemented important economic reforms that facilitated a decrease in the national poverty rate from 37.4 percent in 2007 to 17.5 percent in 2021. The reforms led to improved income and living conditions for the country’s bottom 40 percent. However, more than half of the population remain in poverty according to the upper middle-income line (US$6.86 per person per day in 2017 Purchasing Power Parity). Although inequality declined after 2010, with a Gini Index of 36.4 in 2021, Georgia has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. The incidence of poverty and inequality is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. However, poverty dropped by over six percent in rural areas, and by two percent in urban Georgia. 3. As a result of the war in Ukraine, global food and fertilizer prices have increased with negative impacts on agricultural exports. Domestic food price inflation in Georgia was 15.8 percent in August 2022. In 2021, agriculture contributed 27 percent of total exports, and agriculture export values increased during the past decade. However, from January to November 2022, exports of fruits, nuts, and vegetables amounted to approximately US$166 million, 17 percent below the same period in 2021. At the same time, domestic demand for fruit and vegetables increased, thus providing market opportunities for local produce. Physical access to Russian markets also has been constrained, affected by the financial sanctions. Despite these constraints, Russia remains the largest export destination for fruits, nuts, and vegetables, followed by Italy and Germany. Nonetheless, the war highlights the importance of agriculture competitiveness to increase export diversification.4. Climate change is a critical risk to Georgia’s development and stability, particularly for the agriculture sector. Current trends, such as increasing temperatures, eroding soils, intensifying droughts, floods, and an increased occurrence of hail, are expected to reduce yields in major agricultural regions, including the eastern regions, where irrigation is prevalent. The availability of water resources is highly seasonal in Georgia. Rivers fed by glaciers and snow, such as the Khrami-Debed and Alazani, are projected to see reduced flows between 30 percent and 55 percent by the end of the 21st century, posing a threat to an important source of water supply. Precipitation is also projected to decrease during the farming season (June–August) and increase in autumn, spring, and winter. Up to 30 consecutive dry days are expected by mid-century, increasing agricultural water scarcity, and reducing crop productivity during the summer months. Droughts are expected to exert further pressure on water availability. The annual risk exposure of the population to climate change is estimated to be between 1.5 and 6.6 percent of Georgia’s national GDP (that is, between US$238 million and US$1.04 billion annually). B. Sectoral and Institutional ContextSectoral Context5. Constraints and opportunities in Georgia’s agriculture, water, and land sectors are interlinked. Land and water are finite resources upon which agricultural production and productivity depend. While agriculture in Georgia is primarily rainfed, irrigation and drainage (I&D) investments are vital to guard against hydrological variability, and critical for high-value agriculture production. The eastern part of the country requires irrigation to buffer climatic extremes, while the western part is confronted with drainage problems. In most parts of the country, however, I&D infrastructure has deteriorated due to lack of maintenance and reduced financial resources allocated to I&D management. Pressure on fragmented land resources is also growing, making improvements in agricultural land management in Georgia critical for increasing productivity. Due to these interlinked challenges in the agriculture, water, and land sectors, interventions to address them must be implemented in the three sectors concurrently.6. The agriculture sector accounted for 41 percent of all jobs in 2017 and continues to be important in the poorer and more rural parts of the country, which are most vulnerable to climate risks. Approximately 41 percent of the total population live in rural areas, and the majority of those living in those areas rely partly on agriculture for their livelihoods. Subsistence agriculture makes up 73 percent of employment in rural areas. Almost 80 percent of rural farmers operate less than 1 hectare (ha) of agricultural land. Most smallholdings produce crops primarily for subsistence purposes and lack direct commercial potential. Productivity is low and stagnant for most crop and livestock products, both in absol ute terms and relative to comparator countries. Present and future climate change pose further risks to production and livelihoods for these marginal groups. Past droughts (a severe event occurred in 2000) caused wheat yields to drop by more than half. 7. According to the most recent agricultural census conducted in 2014, the share of commercial farms producing higher-value crops for export remains low. Forward and backward links with input suppliers and the agro-processing sector are weak, although their improvement would have a positive impact on agriculture modernization, value chain development, and competitiveness. Despite the apparent limitations of smallholder farms, a small but increasing number of medium-size and larger commercially oriented producers and agri-business enterprises are driving the development of domestic market and export-oriented value chains (World Bank 2022). From 2010 to 2020, the value of exports of agricultural food products, especially high-value commodities such as wine, hazelnuts, fruits, and vegetables, more than doubled, while imports remained stable. As new export markets are being explored, private investment in processing capacity has started to increase, and various canned, dried, and frozen products are being exported to the EU, the United States (US), and other markets. 8. Following independence in 1991, Georgia experienced a turbulent transition period resulting in the deterioration of a large part of its irrigation infrastructure. This caused a sharp decline in the irrigated area. From 2012 to 2020, the public irrigable area steadily increased to about 130,000 ha, of which about 6,500 ha is served by pumping systems. In addition, some of Georgia's dams are aging and in need of repair or rehabilitation. Thus, in recent years, GoG took steps to improve dam safety in the country. The Ministry of Environment Protection and Agriculture (MEPA) established regulations and guidelines for the design, construction, and maintenance of dams. GOG also produced an upcoming draft law “on the safety of hydraulic structures and launched several projects to upgrade existing dams and build new, safer ones.9. In 2020, there was a total of 123 irrigation schemes in use and the actual irrigated area was about 65,000 ha, according to the Georgian Ameliorat",[],[],[],[],[],"['livestock', 'processing', 'smallholder']","['livestock', 'processing', 'smallholder']"

The SRASP AF will finance the following activities aiming to improve the enabling environment, and ensure the availability of improved, locally adapted, market oriented, farmer-preferred, and climate resilient seeds, seedlings, and planting materials for priority crops, in sufficient quantity and quality:Sub-component 1.1: Enabling environment, the the AF will increase the amount of funding allocated to this sub-component (co-financing), and the objective of the sub-component, which is improving the enabling environment of the seed, seedling, and planting materials system will be broadened to include food and nutrition security. The additional resources allocated to the sub-component will help the government to: (i) develop a FSCPP-to be financed from government own funding, (ii) review the existing Food Security Law #1591 (April 2019); and (iii) review the institutional arrangements for food and nutrition security The FSCPP will help in addressing the impacts of acute shocks, and the AF support will include preparing semi-annual reports for food security coordination bodies on risks, resilience, and immediate food security measures that need to be taken; and developing an M&E framework to provide timely and reliable information to facilitate informed decision-making on food security program management, as a part of an M&E system for implementation of the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) 2022-2030. The Food Security Law does not provide a clear structure for ensuring food security. Its revision is required especially with regard to the roles of the FSC and MOA to ensure coordination and harmonization of the efforts between stakeholders, including the private sector. Moreover, the current version of the Law is centered on self-sufficiency rather than food security. This definition of food security is not in line with the international understanding and the definition employed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The current law does not enable an efficient response for early warning and swift action to address emerging food security risks and prioritize increased resilience.Sub-component 1.2: No changeSub-component 1.3: Multiplication of seeds, seedlings, and planting materials, the SRASP AF will scale up the sub-component scope to include emergency procurement and distribution of improved seeds and fertilizers to farmers and vulnerable groups. The SRASP AF will support (co-finance) the procurement and distribution of seeds, fertilizers and small scale innovative farm machinery to vulnerable dehkan farmers and women, including to simplify women's manual labor; and provision of training for seed multiplication, seedlings and planting material and the use of small innovative equipment to vulnerable farmers. To improve the access to irrigation of dehkan farmers and women who will benefit from seeds, fertilizers, and small-scale innovative farm machinery, the SRASP AF will finance rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes through installation of energy efficient irrigation pumps and small works for rehabilitation of existing irrigation networks, including replacement of outdated non-performing pump units servicing existing irrigated land areas, as well as minor (emergency-type) rehabilitation of off-farm and on-farm irrigation infrastructure. The SRASP AF design will also look into supporting potential additional measures that may address the acute bottlenecks in food distribution and production systems, including targeting vulnerable households, returning migrants, and women..Sub-component 1.4: No change Component 2: Support investments in agri-logistical centers (ALCs) for horticulture value chains. The objectives and sub-component structure of the component will remain the same. The SRASP AF will allow the component to scale up activities of the parent project by supporting the establishment and operationalization of additional ALCs with the objective of building resilient food systems, promoting agricultural diversification, ensuring better market linkages, and improving competitiveness of horticulture value chains and access to markets.Sub-component 2.1: Support the establishment and operation of ALCs, the SRASP AF will support (co-finance) the establishment and operationalization of two additional ALCs in geographical locations to be identified following the same procedure and operation and management modality as in the parent project. The design feature (small in size) and services (cooling, storage, packing. Logistic facilities etc.) of the ALCs will also be the same as the parent project..Sub-component 2.2: No change Component 3: Strengthen public capacity for crises prevention and management. The objectives of the component and sub-components will remain the same, but there will be a new sub-component that will be included. The proposed SRASP AF-will allow the component to include additional activities that will further strengthen the capacity of the public sector to prevent and manage crises, and the new sub-component will help improve nutritional outcomes.

The Additional Financing (AF) would be used to consolidate and expand project activities showing strong results to secure a higher level of impact on the Project’s development objectives. The results framework will be updated at project appraisal to capture the additional outputs and outcomes envisaged to be generated during the AF period. The AF will scale up activities to boost farm production, market access, and crisis response in components 1 and 2, and enhance project coordination and management capacity in component 4. A new Component 5 will be added to improve food availability and support community agricultural investments. All scaled-up and new activities will build directly on relevant methods and structures put in place under the parent project. Implementation arrangements, responsible agencies, and partner institutions from the parent project will be retained in full, including the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the Ministry of Agriculture.Food insecurity is surging in Liberia. The current WFP hunger map indicates that 1.7 million Liberians (about 37 percent of the population) have insufficient food consumption. Additionally, 4.3 percent of children under five face acute malnutrition while 30.1 percent of these under-five children face chronic malnutrition. Admissions for moderate acute malnutrition in children and nursing women increased by over 10 percent between December 2021 and January 2022 and admissions for severe acute malnutrition in children and nursing women increased by over 3 percent between December 2021 and January 2022 and were 13 percent higher than the January 2021 level. In response to the crisis, a Technical Assessment of the described food insecurity crisis was undertaken to demonstrate eligibility for the Crisis Response Window – Early Response Financing (CRW-ERF). The CRW-ERF Technical Expert Group on Food Security (TEGFS) confirmed that the food security trends, conditions, and projections qualify Sierra Leone for local-based activation for CRW ERF resources. In response to the food and nutrition crisis in the country, the Government of Liberia (GoL) has worked with partners (including the World Bank, UN agencies, and donors) to develop a US$120 million Quick Action Food Security Response Plan (QA-FSRP) that provides a framework for interventions to protect the 1.68 million most vulnerable people. The QA-FSRP focuses on short-term measures that protect the most vulnerable from food shortages and negative food security and nutrition impacts of price spikes while also seeking to create a roadmap for medium to long-term investment to boost agriculture productivity. Specifically, the objectives of the plan are to (i) improve short-term food availability and access (especially for rice) through facilitating the import and distribution of food, efficient management of food reserves, avoidance of policy interventions in food markets, and protecting the purchasing power of poor households; (ii) prepare for and support future rice harvests through agricultural input acquisition and distribution, expanded mechanization, financial, and advisory services for farmers and agricultural small and medium enterprises (SMEs), conditional cash transfers to youth for increased local food production in prioritized areas; and (iii) improve crisis monitoring, evaluation, coordination, and management; and putting in place contingency plans to deal with the impacts of acute shocks.The proposed AF responds to the Government’s request to support the QA-FSRP. The AF will contribute to filling the financing gap, with World bank funds supporting two QA-FSRP objectives: (i) preparing and supporting future harvests, focusing on rice; and (ii) improving crisis monitoring, evaluation, coordination, and management. Aligned with the above, the AF would fund t he following specific additional activities:1. Component 1: Improving the Enabling Environment for Agribusiness Development (original project US$6 million – with restructuring US$3 million): The proposal is to scale down project activities under this component in support of the capacity building of public agribusiness services, value chain coordination, and support to agricultural research and development, and extension. While still relevant to the overall objective of the project, these activities to be scaled down are now being pursued and funded through the ongoing Bank-financed Smallholder Agriculture Transformation and Agribusiness Revitalization Project (STAR-P, P160945) with which coordination will be strengthened to ensure synergy and complementarity. A total of US$3 million earlier committed to these activities under the parent project will now be deployed to productive activities (US$1.5 million) under Component 2 and Project Coordination and Management (US$1.5 million) to finance needed expertise to support the strengthening of early warning systems and food security crisis preparedness planning; and technical assistance (TA) for project coordination, monitoring, and evaluation. 2. Component 2: Enhancing Competitiveness and Market Access through Productive Alliances (original project US$12.5 million; with restructuring US$14 million): Resource allocation to Component 2 has been increased by US$1.5 million. This financing will go towards scaling up pre-investment activities that are designed to support the development of proposals for investment subprojects (i.e., towards services of the Fund Manager), and towards the provision of matching grants to smallholders. As in the parent project, all pre-investment activities will emphasize a better understanding of climate change risks and available adaptation and mitigation options including (i) the use of climate-resilient seed varieties; (ii) investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the adoption of practices that will prevent soil erosion and retain soil nutrients; (iii) improved water management; and (iv) efficient methods and technologies to manage pests and diseases (see Annex 3 for planned climate change adaptation and mitigation measure planned under the AF). 3. Component 3: Agri-Marketing and Road Infrastructure Investments (original project US$31.5 million): No change is proposed to this component. 4. Component 4: Project Coordination and Management and Contingency Emergency Response (original project US$5 million; with restructuring US$6.5 million): An additional US$1.5 million is proposed for Project Management and Coordination to enhance the technical and organizational capacity of implementing agencies. This will include: (i) strengthening the PIU staffing with the competitive recruitment of a food security specialist to support the strengthening of early warning systems and food security crisis preparedness planning; (ii) the development of a food security crisis preparedness plan after the effectiveness of the project; and (iii) TA for specific activities including preparation of several documents (environmental and social instruments, etc.); monitoring and evaluation (M&E) surveys and studies (baseline, mid-term review, completion report, and impact evaluation); citizen engagement, management of a Grievances Redress Mechanism (GRM), including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) specialized in the prevention and management of SEA/SH risks; a Third-Party Monitoring Agency (TPMA) which will be contracted to monitor project activities. 5.

Phase I includes Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Togo, along with three regional organizations - the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research (CORAF) and the Permanent Interstate Committee for drought control in the Sahel (CILSS). The Program Development Objective (PrDO) is to increase preparedness against food insecurity and improve the resilience of food systems in participating countries. All Phase I countries and organizations are effective and making progress against their targets, and towards the overall achievement of the PrDO. The Program has the following three technical components: i) Component 1, Digital Advisory Services for Agriculture and Food Crisis Prevention and Management, has the objective to upgrade regional food crisis prevention and management systems and enhance food system stakeholder’s access and use of agro-hydrometeorological information services: ii) Component 2, Sustainability and Adaptive Capacity of the Food System’s Productive Base, aims to strengthen national and regional agricultural research systems as well as the implementation of Integrated Landscape Management (ILM) in selected communities. The third component of the program, Regional Food Market Integration and Trade, is supposed to elevate intra-regional food trade and increase value creation in selected value chains. In addition to the three technical components, the program includes (iv) a Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) as Component 4; and (v) Component 5 Project Management. Activities under each component have been launched.On July 29, 2022, US$315 million of IDA was approved by the World Bank Board of Directors for a second phase of the FSRP MPA. The total approved amount includes national and regional IDA to Sierra Leone (US$60 million), Chad (US$105 million) and Ghana (US$150 million), bringing the total MPA envelope to US$716 million (including resources not approved in the original envelope). The Project Development Objective (PDO) for FSRP- Sierra Leone (FSRP-SL) is to increase preparedness against food insecurity and improve the resilience of food systems in Sierra Leone. The Project was signed on August 22, 2022 with an effectiveness deadline of November 19. Given the urgency of the Additional Financing (AF), the team is working to achieve effectiveness ahead of this deadline. Effectiveness is expected to be achieved by November 7, 2022. There are no results to-date but a first Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) was approved on October 21, 2022, and all of the ratings were Satisfactory. The proposed AF will build on the design of on-going FSRP Phase II MPA. Targeting under the AF will focus on scaling-up immediate and medium-term activities falling within the FSRP-SL objectives, components, and geographical areas leveraging FSRP-SL’s implementation modalities. This will be achieved by (i) replenishing the US$25 million that was reallocated from Component 2 to emergency response activities when activating the CERC; and (ii) scaling-up investments under Components 2 and 3 in infrastructure and technologies to support improved production for the next cropping season. New targets will be added at PDO level, and new indicators will be added for activities under Components 2, 3 and 4. FSRP-SL is designed to address challenges to food system resilience and food security in Sierra Leone, including: (i) low growth of food system productivity compared to population growth; (ii) falling per capita food availability; (iii) limited access to improved technologies, modern inputs, and advisory services; (iii) weak access to markets due to inadequate post-harvest, and market infrastructure; and (iv) limited processing capacity and value-added activities. FSRP-SL thus provides a strong foundation on which to address several production and marketing related aspects of the unfolding food and nutrition security crisis facing Sierra Leone while also contributing to longer-term resilience of crisis-affected households and communities. The SL FSRP will be implemented in all districts of Sierra Leone and focused on the three priority value chains: rice, cassava, and livestock. These value chains were selected because of their potential for regional food and nutrition security, and the natural comparative advantage that Sierra Leone has in developing and promoting them. For the respective value chains, the following ten districts will be targeted: (i) Rice – Bonthe, Port Loko, Tonkolili, Bo, Kenema and Kambia; (ii) Cassava – Bonthe, Bo, Moyamba, Tonkolili and Pujehun; and (iii) Livestock – Bo, Moyamba, Koinadugu, Falaba. The selection criteria for the areas of intervention were based on (i) food insecurity; (ii) the agro-sylvo-pastoral potential; (iii) national and regional impact; and (iv ) complementarity with past/ongoing projects. While the project has not yet had sufficient time to generate substantial lessons learned, the FSRP benefits from an accompanying trust fund (the Food Systems Resilience Facility, FSRF, P172941) that produces analytical work to support the continued learning within the MPA. Within this framework, knowledge has been generated related to risk management, conflict and crisis, trade and markets and impact evaluation methodologies, all of which is being systematically streamlined into Phase I and Phase 2 of the MPA.",[],[],[],[],[],"['livestock', 'pastoral', 'processing']","['livestock', 'pastoral', 'processing']"

With the support of the World Bank, the Somaliland and Puntland states piloted low cost and conflict deterring water solutions under the Water for Agro-Pastoralist Livelihoods Pilot Project (WALP), a US$2 million pilot that resulted in the building of eight sand dams over the period 2016 to 2018. This investment paved the way for the ongoing Water for Agro Pastoral Productivity and Resilience (Biyoole) Project. The increased budget (US$42 million) allowed to scale up activities across Puntland, Galmudug and South West States. The two projects validate the country’s approach to increasing water catchment in the drylands through sand dams which have the potential to protect water from high evapotranspiration whilst supplying in small amounts water for both domestic and agricultural consumption. The dams being small and not requiring extensive land masses to build pose less conflicts of which can be managed through both community level and high level conflict resolution mechanisms. The Biyoole project is building capacity in issues of policies, regulations and guidelines. Biyoole II, continues this trajectory by scaling up the investments and introducing environmental catchment services.The project will use an environmental catchment approach. The project will: increase access to domestic and productive water services, strengthen climate change adaptation and resilience, increase agricultural and livestock production and development through tailored extension services for water and environmental management and build the capacity of line institutions to provide basic services that address poverty and strengthen resilience. This project will: (a) improve access to water infrastructure among rural communities; (b) strengthen management of natural resources—e.g., water, land, forests, rangelands; (c) strengthen agricultural knowledge and innovation systems for livelihoods development. The project will deliver water harvesting and storage infrastructure and facilitate community action to help restore the quality of the land. It will leverage sand dam and other water-harvesting technology to enhance the adaptive capacity of Somalia’s dry lands and the livelihoods that depend on them. Through rigorous social mobilization processes, the project will help communities better understand how their decisions about management of land and water resources affect their well-being and how to become more climate-resilient. Communities will be aided to improve the quality of their land and water resources and to invest in the technology, training, and services necessary to improve crop production, pasture management and fodder production, animal health, and productivity. With improved organization and knowledge, communities can manage a more inclusive development agenda that increases the availability of water and food for all their member households and supports sustainable livelihoods that generate income for households that can be saved to help them better withstand inevitable future shocks.While the central and northern Somalia has water scarcity, the southern Somalia has both water management and water scarcity challenges.

In 2009, The Brazilian government created the National Policy on Climate Change – NPCC (Law 12,187/2009) to guide the country to fulfil with the national voluntary commitment to reduce GHG emissions between 36.1% and 38.9% of the projected emissions by 2020. Brazil’s 1988 Federal Constitution recognizes the social organization, customs, languages, beliefs and traditions of indigenous peoples and other traditional communities as well as their rights to occupy their traditional territories. The Federal Constitution (Articles 215 and 216) determines that the State protects popular, indigenous and Afro-Brazilian cultural manifestations and that the Brazilian cultural heritage must be promoted and protected by the Public Power, considering both material and immaterial goods – the way of expressing, being and living – of the different groups that make up the Brazilian society. The Biodiversity Law (Law 13.123/2015) protects the traditional knowledge associated with the genetic heritage of indigenous peoples, traditional communities or traditional farmers against illicit use and exploitation. Finally, Brazil signed the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention No.169 on Indigenous Peoples and Tribal Populations and The United Nations Declaration of Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and regulated its provisions. ILO Convention 169 was regulated and made effective in Brazil with the publication of Decree 5,051/04.The proposed Brazil DGM Phase 2 will rely on and aim to expand the achievements made by the Brazil DGM Phase 1 project. Phase 1 was an ambitious and innovative effort to address the climate change consequences of rapid land-use change in the Cerrado biome, which has made relevant contributions to: (i) strengthen the connections between IPQTCs, (ii) enhance the institutional capacity of their representative organizations, (iii) expand their understanding of climate change and REDD+, (iv) promote sustainable natural resources management and livelihoods within their territories and (v) recovery from adverse impacts of the pandemic. At the end, project beneficiaries have been empowered to protect natural resources over an area above six million hectares. Considering the lessons learned with and the satisfactory implementation of the Brazil DGM Phase 1, the proposed Phase 2 also comprises three components that have been agreed upon during consultations held with IPQTCs and Peoples from the Cerrado Biome:Component 1: Sustainable Initiatives (Estimated budget USS 650,000). Under this component, technical assistance and subgrants will be provided to implement sustainable initiatives proposed by IPQTCs, representative organizations and Regional Networks. These initiatives will be selected by the DGM National Steering Committee and must focus on: (i) Sustainable livelihoods subprojects and (ii) Adaptation to climate-change. The component will also allocate resources for the provision of technical assistance in support of the selected community subprojects (up to 15 percent of the subproject value). Technical assistance may be provided by the Executing Agency with in-house capacity or by social organizations or private firms located closer to the beneficiary communities.Component 2: Capacity Building, Communication and Knowledge Exchange (Estimated budget US$ 100,000). Under this component, the Brazil DGM Phase 2 will support: (i) The meetings of the Brazil DGM National Steering Committee; (ii) Capacity building training events aimed at: (a) enhancing managerial skills and access of beneficiary communities to markets; (b) promoting sustainable natural resources management practices and climate-smart livelihood practices such as agroecology; and (c) valuing traditional healing practices and knowledge of the Cerrado biodiversity; and (iii) The elaboration and distribution of good practices factsheets (digital and printed versions) on climate change adaptation, sustainable natural resources management practices and climate-smart livelihood practices supported by the Project as well as other well-recognized initiatives.Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (Estimated budget US$ 180,000). Under this component, the project will support: (i) The administrative and fiduciary management of the grant, including the technical coordination of Components 1 and 2, and monitoring and evaluation; (ii) the implementation of the environmental and social risk management instruments according to the World Bank Environmental and Social Standards; and (iii) the two Auditing Reports.The project is consistent with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2018–23 for the Federative Republic of Brazil (Report no. 113259-BR) discussed by the Executive Directors on July 16, 2017. The CPF proposes a reorientation of new lending and advisory services and analytics toward supporting the government in addressing the main development constraints identified in the Systematic Country Diagnostic, including natural resource management. The proposed project would directly contribute to the third focus area of the CPF (Inclusive and Sustainable Development), namely by conserving and fostering the recovery of the Cerrado. The engagement in the country (and specifically in the Cerrado) seeks to: (i) combine conservation with the promotion of local and regional economic development; (ii) support increased sustainability of agricultural production and forestry; (iii) focus on long-term solutions to further capitalize on its natural resource assets (a vast quantity of biodiversity content and the world’s largest forest carbon stocks) in a sustainable manner; and (iv) improve the sustainable management of natural resources and enhance resilience to climate shocks, while maximizing contributions to local economic development and enabling local communities, civil society and the private sector to participate actively in policy formulation and implementation.",[],[],[],[],[],['genetic'],['genetic']

This will be achieved through a combination of investments to: (i) restore and enhance the productivity of selected landscapes by notably rehabilitating small scale water management infrastructures and investing in soil conservation and restoration as well as afforestation; (ii) support producers’ ability to tap into the productive potential of the restored landscapes by promoting access to climate smart agricultural technologies and services; and (iii) consolidating the economic base of rural households in the project area by supporting of Income Generating Activities (IGAs) and facilitating entrepreneurial activities. The planning and selection of investments will rely strongly on a participatory planning process, conducted at the sub-watershed level, and which engages local communities to express their needs and priorities. The component will also strengthen the capacity of institutions involved with a focus on the MoA and affiliated entities. It will include activities focused on the specific needs of women and youth.Sub-Component 1.1: Sub-watershed level planning and restoration of landscapes will restore and further develop selected landscapes as well as accelerate adoption of more climate-resilient agriculture practices on this newly productive foundation. Sub-Component 1.2: Consolidation and diversification of the local income base (Income Generating Matching Grant-IGM program). SC 1.2 will provide matching grants to promote IGAs, including: (i) innovation and diversification of crop activities to enhance income generation and resilience; (ii) simple primary processing and marketing of traditional products, giving priority to those that are adapted to climate-change; and (iii) provision and sale of basic agricultural services such as crop treatment services, rental of equipment, sale of inputs, transportation or storage. Sub-Component 1.3 - Institutional support to MoA’s services and affiliated entities. Project execution will involve incremental activities which are novel and for which MoA’s services and affiliated entities may still have limited operational capabilities. Hence, the need to provide institutional support to build the required capacity to implement these activities. SC 1.3 will support two key project public implementing structures : MoA and CNRADA . It will provide targeted technical assistance and capacity building in the following areas covering both Components 1 and 2, inter alia for (i) Component 1: preparation of landscape restoration plans to improve agriculture productivity in the rainfed context; and (ii) Component 2: design and set-up of the public investments in the pilot ZOCA block(s)Component 2 – Inclusive commercial agriculture (US$27.5 million) will pave the way for the development of highly intensive agriculture production systems by large agribusiness investors and small and medium agri-entrepreneurs under Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) established between the State, the external investors and the local communities. On that basis, Component 2 will support the development on two pilot Zone(s) of Agriculture Growth Opportunity (ZOCA) on suitable potentially irrigable land sites. The pilot ZOCA perimeters selected will be embedded each one in a Sub-Watershed areas to be restored and preserved under Component 1. This will permit to implement the complete set of activities promoted under the project and ensure complete liaison between the two components in two watersheds.The project support to the pilot ZOCA perimeter(s) is intended to test operational scenarios for the entire ZOCA program that would permit to attract investors interested in developing large-scale land-based agro-industrial operations (blocks of 300-400 ha), and allow small and medium agri-entrepreneurs (5-20 ha) to develop intensive commercial agriculture alongside the large producers. The availability of land for the ZOCA block(s) selected will be negotiated with local communities. Negotiations with communities and implementation of the PPP process underlying ZOCA deployment will be predicated on a go/ no-go sequence of steps involving all interested parties. The component will finance (i) the basic productive infrastructure to make the sites viable and ready for the required additional investments by large external investors; (ii) a program of small-grants to support the productive activities of small and medium size entrepreneurs; and (iii) the development of the regulatory framework and technical modalities for the ZOCA program, and technical assistance and capacity building to institutions involved in the program.Sub-Component 2.1: Planning and implementation of ZOCA public investments to lay the foundation for the development of intensive irrigated production systems on the selected ZOCA site(s) by (i) providing assistance to the planning of the ZOCA deployment, including the selection of the ZOCA investors; and (ii) financing basic public productive infrastructures. MoE will oversee the implementation of SC 2.1, in close coordination with MoA for technical support.Sub-Component 2.2: Support to small and medium agri-entrepreneurs (Small Grant Program-SGP). SC 2.2 will support an SGP program in the form of matching grants for eligible agricultural production and service activities developed by small and medium entrepreneurs. Eligible sub-projects will focus on agriculture production and supporting activities all along the value chains developed on the ZOCA blocks. Sub-Component 2.3: Institutional support to MoE and other ZOCA implementing structures. Since project activities under Components 2 involve novel areas of intervention for which Mauritanian implementers and stakeholders may still have limited expertise and experience, institutional support will be needed to assist the deployment of the ZOCA program. SC 2.3 will build the capacity of project implementing structures, as part of two sets of activities: (i) support to MoE and other implementing structures for the planning and steering of the overall ZOCA program, and for the implementation of the ZOCA pilots to be financed by the project; and (ii) support to local communities and to the territorial services of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Interior for ZOCA land-related matters.Component 3 - Project management, monitoring and evaluation (US$5 million). Component's objective is twofold: (i) provide the means to ensure proper project management. It will support the functioning of the Project Management Unit (PMU) at central and provincial (wilaya) levels. The component will finance (i) the operating costs of the PMU, including consultant fees, daily subsistence allowances and running costs, such as transport, office equipment, furniture, tools, and internal and external audits, etc.; (ii) staff training (with focus on the Environmental and Social Management Framework – ESMF, MIS and Kobotool Box, f",[],[],[],[],[],['processing'],['processing']

The first phase is an IPF of $150M, the second phase is a P4Rof$150M, and the third phase another P4R of $200M. The current PAD and ESRS were prepared for the purposes of Phase I which willcover 6 Provinces and focus on productive sectors in rural areas, including agriculture, livestock and fisheries. Phase I is aUS$ 150 million IDA IPF Grant, focusing on the following main objectives: (i) increasing agriculture productivity and market accessby targeted smallholders, (ii) increasing value added by targeted AgriMSMEs, and (iii) improving natural resources managementpractices in selected regions. This first phase will cover a period of 5 years and be focused on building institutional capacityfor delivering key services and support to smallholders and AgriMSMEs, while also improving the stewardship over natural resourcesin the targeted rural areas.The proposed US$ 54 million Additional Financing aims at introducing a new Improving FNS component(US$35.7 million) which will have three new subcomponents. (a) New Subcomponent 5.1: Small infrastructure (US$10.80 million)which will finance the following: (i) Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes (US$1.64 million). The rehabilitation of three smallirrigation schemes that were badly damaged by the cyclones in Zambezia (US$1.62 million). The three schemes are located in thedistricts of Nicoadala and Maganja da Costa and total about 860 ha, which are all farmed by smallholders.(ii) Rehabilitation ofrural roads (US$4.75 million). This is the rehabilitation of selected market access rural roads which are key for producers andother actors to boost the development of value chains but which have been badly damaged by the cyclones. As already foreseen inSREP, the activities foreseen in the AF are localized interventions, specifically the rehabilitation of critical elementson selected rural roads and supervision of the execution of the referred works. This work will be led by FNDS in coordination withthe National Roads Administration (Administração Nacional de Estradas, ANE) on the basis of a memorandum of understanding alreadyin place.(iii) Construction/installation of boreholes and water tanks (US$4.41 million). To improve access to water supply indistricts in semiarid zones and districts with systems damaged by weather events, multipurpose boreholes will be built togetherwith water tanks and public fountains mainly for drinking and sanitation purposes but potentially also for limited (drip fororchards) irrigation use. The pre-molded cisterns are expected to have a capacity of 10,000 m³ and be capable of accumulating andconserving rainwater and be located mainly in the proximity of schools and health centers.New Subcomponent 5.2: Support to smallfarmers and livestock breeders (US$22 million). This subcomponent will finance the following: (i) Provision of agriculturalkits/seeds (US$15.09 million). The AF will provide agricultural input kits (available for free) to selected beneficiaries inemergency conditions in the selected 53 districts following the ‘fomento directo’ approach. The same rules which were adopted andregistered in the operations manual in MozNorte to support the farming communities in need will be used. No large pieces ofequipment (with the exception of small equipment, see point iii) will be provided, while it is expected to make wide use ofnutritious and drought-tolerant crops to increase households’ resilience to climate shocks.(ii) Provision of hermetic bags,installation of family silos (US$1.81 million). Most family farmers do not have a drying and storage structure for grains andbeans, having to pay a high price, or sell the produce and buy it later, to meet the family’s needs. The AF plans to make hermeticbags and small family silos available, in the form of a donation, to conserve the food reserve and reduce post-harvest losses.(iii) Provision of small equipment/tools (US$0.72 million). Most family farmers do not have proper tools to farm such as spades,groundnut rakes, hay pitchforks, and cutters, besides galoshes and gloves. The AF plans to make those available for free to allowmore effective use of farmers’ time, improve the quality of production, and reduce losses.(iv) Building of small livestockinfrastructure (US$2.94 million). Within the area affected by Tropical Storm Ana, several districts in four provinces (mainlyZambezia, Tete, Nampula, and Manica) are currently experiencing problems linked to livestock both in terms of lost units anddestroyed small livestock infrastructure and potential outbreak of diseases, which would need to be detected and cured on time (seebelow). A total of 527 installations (fences, hog houses, poultry houses, and so on) of small breeders were destroyed (plus severalthousand at the household level) and need to be rebuilt by using stronger materials and more resilient techniques.(v) Provision ofequipment for the veterinary lab in Tete (US$0.44 million). The lab is currently not functioning and hampers the possibility forsmall breeders to sell their product in the market and to the new abattoir. (vi) Provision of diagnostic consumables to theveterinary service in Nampula (US$0.16 million). The veterinary service in Nampula was weakened by the cyclones and does not havesufficient consumables to run diagnostics and handle potential outbreak of diseases. (vii) Establishment of a small ruminantscheme (US$0.84 million). The scheme will be implemented in four districts, which still need to be selected. The allocation ofgoats (four females and one male) and specific training to households aim to promote animal health, improve family income, andimprove food availability and nutrition outcomes. The animals will be delivered on a rotational basis to households to ensure thatthe greatest number of families in the communities are reached. The household that receives the first batch of five animals has theobligation to return two offspring to another family within one year. The delivery process of successive lambs will be accompaniedby the local District Service of Economic Activity (Serviços Distritais de Actividade Economica, SDAE) offices. The project mustensure that 50 percent of the animals distributed will be provided to families that currently have no ruminants.C- NewSubcomponent 5.3: Implementing a local approach to improve nutrition (US$2.90 million). This subcomponent will finance thefollowing:(i) Training in utilization of local products for enhanced nutrition security (US$1.19 million). This is a training oftrainers’ activity that is focused on educating households on what should be included in a balanced diet and uses the existinglocal agricultural produce. It will be implemented by SDAE extensionists and Community Health Workers or (Agentes PolivalenteElementar de Saude - APEs) and is aimed at teaching how farmers could produce, in the yard or on the plot, for example, producewhich would be healthy but is not easily available in the market (or available in markets that are too distant), and will alsoprovide advice on how forestry products and/or meat and/or fish could be integrated in farmers’ diet. The list of products couldalso include those that are mostly directed to export but have high nutrition content. A module on officinal plants and herbs willalso be developed and taught. (ii) Mobile nutrition kitchens (US$1.71 million). The experience of past and ongoing successfulprojects in several part of the world show that mobile kitchens are a means of communication capable of inducing behavioral change.In this case, it is proposed to support the activities of the 60 nutritionists already trained by the United Nations Children'sFund (UNICEF) (staff from the Ministry of Health, SETSAN, and INGC) and provide them with the means to travel in the",[],[],[],[],[],"['animal health', 'hay', 'lambs', 'livestock', 'market access', 'meat', 'poultry', 'veterinary']","['animal health', 'hay', 'lambs', 'livestock', 'market access', 'meat', 'poultry', 'veterinary']"

Component 1 focuses on knowledge creation and territorial planning for climate resilience. It will support: (i) the first ever forest and rangelands national inventory to create knowledge and operationalize monitoring and evaluation systems; (ii) development of forests, pastoral lands and fisheries management plans; (iii) the integration of climate considerations in development and territorial planning in selected Communes; and (iv) the enabling environment for the implementation of the National Determined Contribution (NDC) and Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). Component 2 focuses on promoting investments aiming on one hand to rehabilitate and restore landscapes to improve and reestablish their environmental services and on other hand to strengthen livelihood resilience by diversifying economic assets and improving access to new markets for producers and/or producer organizations’ products. Component 3 will support coordination, communication, and monitoring and evaluation of the project. A fourth Contingency Emergence Response Component (CERC) is added to facilitate response to a potential crisis as needed.COMPONENT 1. Knowledge creation and territorial planning for climate resilience (US$20 million)CP1.1 National Forest and pastoral lands inventory (US$8 million)It's urgent for Niger to prepare a national forest and rangelands inventory. The aim of this inventory is i) to establish an overall situation of national forest and rangelands resources, and ii) to provide reliable statistics and maps with more modern and less costly methods. The inventory will include: a national restoration/afforestation plan; deforestation maps, soil maps, and biodiversity inventories. CP1.2 Development of forest, pastoral, and fisheries management plans (US$5 million)Forest (US$2 million), rangeland (US$2 million), and fisheries (US$1 million) management plans are the main legal instruments guiding the management of these ecosystems. All forests, rangelands and fisheries areas in the targeted regions require new or updated management plans. These plans are key to ensuring the sustainable management and maintenance of these renewable resources. CP1.3: Climate informed territorial planning and development in targeted Communes (US$5 million)The preparation of communal development plans (PDC) in Niger is aligned with the communes’ Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES). The 2022 - 2027 PDES is still under finalization and will be published shortly. In this respect, the project will support the updating of the PDCs of the targeted communes, in particular to incorporate NDC commitments, climate change mitigation and adaptation planning and ensure the involvement of local stakeholders, mainly women, in the process.CP1.4: Enabling environment for Niger NDC and LDN implementation (US$2 million) This subcomponent will support (i) the improved functioning of the Niger CDN committee, and (ii) the updating and operationalizing of existing information management systems under the General Directorate of Water and Forests, as well as the development of a national MRV system to ensure the monitoring of the Niger NDC and LDN as part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. .COMPONENT 2: Investments in Landscape Restoration and Community Resilience to Climate Change (US$115 million)Sub-component 2.1: Restoring Landscapes and Ecosystem Services (US$70 million)Targeted investments will include measures aimed at improving carbon pools, preventing soil degradation, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, increasing carbon stock, and restoring lands, favoring biodiversity conservation and biodynamic agriculture (with high potential for mitigation co-benefits). Drought-resistant products will be developed and specific techniques (such as ‘no tillage’ techniques) will reduce water evaporation adaptation co-benefits. Through this subcomponent, the project is seeking to restore 205,000 ha and 11,000 km of hedge and pastoral corridors, through techniques that have been identified in the NDC. The selection of restoration sites will be based on criteria that include, among others, land tenure status, community commitment for sustainable management, whether the site meets technical requirements, vulnerability to climate risks, and the potential to increase carbon sinks.Sub-component 2.2: Improving Local Livelihoods Resilience (US$45 million)This subcomponent aims to enable local producers, especially youths and women, to improve their livelihoods by becoming more competitive producers capable of meeting market demands while improving their resilience to climate change. Activities will focus on three interrelated areas: (i) valorizing and promoting the sustainable development of NTFPs; (ii) the improvement and development of artisanal fisheries products; (iii) promoting the preservation of the cultural and non-tangible capital of local communities; and (iv) establishing and implementing integrated community agro-silvo-pastoral farms (FACIs) as innovative models of economic development and food security.CP2.2.1. Sustainable development of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) (US$20 million)NTFPs provide women and their families with means of subsistence, additional services, and jobs. In this component, activities to enhance women’s cultural heritage and artisanal skills in harvesting and handling products [Baobab (Adansonia digitata), Honey, Doum palm (Hyphaene thebaica), Balanites (Balanites aegyptiaca), the Boscia fruit (Boscia Senegalensis), Marula (Sclerocarya birrea), and Nere (Parkia biglobosa)] will be supported (see Table 5). The value addition to these products will increase women’s income by generating more profits from yield and commercialization. These activities are designed to support women’s entrepreneurship and economic and social empowerment. Supporting the linkages of producer groups to NGOs and off-taker organizations will ensure these small businesses can be sustained beyond the life cycle of the project.CP2.2.2 Fisheries products (US$15 million). The project will support traditional fishing from water reservoirs and community ponds and address the main constraints faced by the sector, which include: (a) inadequate fishing infrastructures (small landing sites) and water bodies, (b) fry production, (c) fish feed production, and (d) fish products transport. Project support will be provided through the normative principles of productive alliances to strengthen collaboration between the public and the private sector and facilitate the access of associated artisanal fishermen to markets. The activity will strengthen the participation of women in the fishing sub-sector, where they are responsible for activities downstream of fishing, such as fish processing, trading etc., all essential for the profitability of this activity. CP2.2.3 Intangible capital (US$3 million). This subcomponent will promote the cultural and non-tangible capital of local communities, and finance initiatives that celebrate and amplify traditional and customary practices related to natural resources. These practices are an essential part of the Sahelian identity and are key to preserving the long history of interaction between the cultural and natural environments. The project will finance activities such as the production of handicrafts, festivals and events. In addition, traditional and customary practices in natural resources management will be prioritized in the techniques promoted by the project for land restoration, fishing, and farming. This sub-component will be implemented by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Handicrafts.CP2.2.4: Community Integrated Agro-Silvo-Pastoral Farms (FACI) (US$7 million).

Economic growth and social gains have nonetheless slowed down. From 2002–2014, some 96,000 people exited poverty annually and gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 4.6 percent. Progress was driven by household earnings because the private sector generates 73 percent of jobs in Bolivia and labor earnings drive both reduced poverty and greater equality. From 2014 to 2018, GDP growth decelerated, the average annual number of people exiting poverty fell significantly to 35,000, and the public sector’s ability to boost progress declined in parallel. The COVID-19 crisis hit Bolivia hard at a time when there is limited fiscal space to respond. Bolivia’s output is estimated to have contracted by 7.8 percent in 2020, its first recession since 1986, and poverty is expected to have increased along with a decline in labor earnings for many households. In May 2020, just after the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, 70 percent of workers interviewed in a World Bank phone survey reported that they had not worked or had lost their jobs during the quarantine period. In addition, the combination of the COVID-19 health and economic emergency and the sharp decline in commodity prices has put macroeconomic stability under further strain, as Bolivia entered the crisis with increasing fiscal deficits and declining international reserves.Agriculture and agribusiness remain key sectors of the economy, accounting for 13 percent of GDP (in 2021), and employing nearly a third of all workers, with a significant impact on poverty reduction. Agriculture is an important source of exports in Bolivia (15 percent of goods exports in 2019) and employment (24 percent in total and 75 percent of rural employment). Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, and La Paz Departments generate 72 percent of total agricultural value added nationwide. Average farm size in the Highlands, Amazon, and Sub-Andean Regions is less than 3 hectares (Ha). Land fragmentation is most acute in the Highlands, where 60 percent of farms are now smaller than 1 Ha. Some 45 percent of total harvested area is industrial commodity production (e.g., soybean), increasing to 80 percent when cereals are included. More productive and climate-smart agriculture reduces negative environmental impacts while increasing the income opportunities of the rural population and promoting food security. Given current global concerns around food security and climate risks, maximizing the high potential of this sector will require an integrated approach, carefully managing land and water resources while increasing outputs. A 2019 Bolivia-specific Stochastic Frontier Analysis recommended the following investments that could effectively increase agricultural technical efficiency and aid less-efficient farmers to reach their technical potential: (a) greater collective action, especially in regions with high land fragmentation; (b) expanded and more inclusive credit programs; (c) leveraging mobile phones for technical and business intelligence; and (d) increased irrigation adoption to increase agricultural intensity, productivity and water use efficiency, promote on-farm diversification and tap into non-traditional markets. Through increased yields and crop intensity, Bolivia can sustainably double agricultural production. Bolivian climate conditions allow for two planting seasons annually (winter and summer). The total harvested area was 3.9 million ha in 2019 covering an annual surface area of 3 million ha, equivalent to a crop intensity of 1.3. Crop intensity could nearly double to 2.03 (or 6.1 million ha of harvested area) through investments in irrigation and improved management practices while protected areas within the official soil use plan boundaries could be preserved.The proposed Project would contribute to adopting climate-smart approaches and increased market access for project beneficiaries in selected agri-food value chains. The design features of the proposed project include:Collective action: The small farmer, acting alone, is unlikely to effectively compete in a market dominated by intermediaries with asymmetric bargaining power and information. Through their participation in value chains, organized rural producers and community organizations can benefit from (a) collective bargaining power in negotiating with other actors in the chain, (b) greater technology uptake, and (c) reduced individual risks through risk spreading.Agricultural transformation: Increased land and labor productivity through fixed investment and improved farm management practices.Resilience: Strengthen the capacity of rural producers and community organizations to withstand climate volatility through investments to adapt and mitigate climate change impacts.Commercial viability: Productive alliances must verify a minimum financial return on their associated business plans to qualify for financing. Participatory innovation: Greater collaboration between rural producers and agricultural research to effectively translate scientific advances into improved farm practices, particularly for small-scale producers targeted under the proposed project.",[],['market access'],[],[],[],"['farm management', 'market access']","['farm management', 'market access']"

First, the project will continue the successful activities introduced under PIPIP, such as upgrading community water conveyance infrastructure (watercourse) and promoting adoption of efficient irrigation technologies. Second, the project will support greater market integration for producers by introducing a new market pull approach in Pakistan centered around productive alliances (PA) between buyers and producers organized in producer groups (PG). This approach will build on global experience regarding PA implementation as well as on the evidence emerging from the Sindh Agriculture Growth Project (SAGP, P128307, Credit 5494-PK) that shows improvements in market access and income from the aggregation of milk producers into PGs.

Finally, interventions under PRIAT will be community demand-driven, support to farmers will be market-driven and solutions will be private sector-led wherever possible. To ensure the demand-driven nature of project-financed activities, the Project Management Unit (PMU) will conduct comprehensive community and farmer consultations periodically so that all activities adequately reflect demands on the ground during the whole project implementation cycle. Through the PA approach, the project will support investments made by farmers to meet market specifications identified with buyers. Like for PIPIP, the private sector will play an indispensable role in watercourse improvement, HEIS installation, and value addition activities. The main beneficiaries of the project include WUAs, individual producers, and PGs. Women will receive tailored support to improve their position in agriculture production, market integration, and access to climate-smart practices and technologies. The proposed project will undertake a study to document the role of women in Punjab’s agriculture sector as a basis for targeted interventions. The Project has four components: Component 1: Community-driven Improvement of Water Conveyance and Application (US$126 million, IDA US$97 million). This component has two objectives: (a) Improve the equity of water access within the watercourse command area by improving the conveyance efficiency; and (b) improve agricultural water productivity by promoting the adoption of climate smart water management practices at community and farm levels. These measures will strengthen climate resilience of the beneficiary households and irrigated agricultural systems. Component 2: Promotion of Climate Smart Production, Regenerative Agriculture, Diversification, Value Addition, and Inclusive Access to Markets (US$118 million, IDA US$85 million). This component seeks to support growth-oriented farmers to (a) diversify, intensify, and add value to their production through a market-driven and climate smart approach; and (b) establish and/or upgrade market linkages with off-takers in a sustainable and profitable way. Producers and PGs (i.e., farmers entrepreneur groups (FEGs)) will receive both TA from local service providers (LSPs) and direct financial support. Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Learning (US$18 million, all IDA). The objective of this component is to ensure that all project activities are implemented effectively and efficiently to achieve the PDO. In addition to traditional project management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), PRIAT will make efforts to facilitate the implementation of some innovations under the project, such as market integration support through PAs and community water resource budgeting and farm level groundwater management. This component will also support a synergistic collaboration between PAD and PID on the broader water resources management agenda. Component 4: Contingent Emergency Response Component (US$0). This component supports preparedness and rapid response to disaster, emergency, and/or catastrophic events, as needed. The provisional zero-cost for this component will allow for the rapid reallocation of credit proceeds from other components under streamlined procurement and disbursement procedures.",[],[],[],[],[],"['market access', 'milk']","['market access', 'milk']"

Like its predecessor, PRAPS-2 has been developed around five technical components, with the addition of focal areas that are essential to holistically address some of the core drivers of resilience among (agro)pastoral populations. The proposed activities will be implemented over a six-year period. Each component will include complementary activities at the national and regional level, conforming to the principle of subsidiarity of interventions between regional and national levels. Institutional capacity building will be supported across components and activities to create an enabling environment to govern the sector in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner.PRAPS-2 interventions will have regional spillover impact. Sahelian (agro)pastoral systems rely on natural resources extending across national boundaries to accommodate climate variability and the seasonality of resources, and they also rely on regional market outlets (mainly in coastal countries) to move livestock and livestock products. At the same time, this activity increases vulnerability to contagious livestock diseases (also termed “transboundary” diseases). PRAPS-2 combines investments at the national level with coordination and support from regional institutions to generate benefits extending beyond the individual countries participating in the Project (regional public goods). These benefits include a reduction in animal health risks in countries that are transit areas or destinations for livestock (which helps to protect livestock capital throughout the region), a reduction in competition for natural resources (which reduces the risks of land degradation and conflict), and improved trade facilitation (which leads to greater economic gains), and overall greater regional stability. PRAPS-2 will play a major role in forging essential cross-sectoral and cross-border collaboration, and it will ensure synergies and complementarities—spatial and thematic—between Project investments and other ongoing and planned interventions.PRAPS-2 will prioritize geographic areas based on three principles: (i) consolidating PRAPS-1 achievements in implementing natural resource and infrastructure governance mechanisms; (ii) reinforcing spatial coherence and clustering along key livestock mobility routes to increase synergies among interventions and avoid the dispersion of investments; and (iii) supporting cross-border cooperation and dialogue in the Sahel Region to tackle cross-border transhumance, regional trade, and planning along selected strategic livestock trade routes. Some interventions will be implemented nationwide, including those related to animal health, social inclusion, and institutional capacity building. The interventions in Niger and Mauritania to be supported through the proposed additional financing (AF) will complement other WB projects and partners interventions to respond to the food insecurity crisis, by providing short to medium term support to boost recovery and resilience of (agro)pastoral populations. The AF will scale up activities foreseen under component 2 and subcomponent 4.3 of the parent project, and add new activities under subcomponent 5.2. Details are provided in the project paper.PRAPS-II is built around the following: components.Component 1: Animal health improvement and veterinary medicine control The main outcome of this component will be increased capacity in Veterinary Services t o protect large and small ruminants from small ruminant plague (PPR) and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), two transboundary animal diseases that cause major losses throughout the region. The proposed Project will pursue investments initiated under PRAPS-1 to establish more robust animal health systems in beneficiary countries (Subcomponent 1.1), finance vaccination and surveillance campaigns primarily targeting PPR and CBPP (Subcomponent 1.2), and support quality control of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) (Subcomponent 1.3). Recognizing the highly contagious nature of PPR and CBPP and the public health threats of misusing VMPs and increasing antimicrobial resistance, this component will be implemented throughout t he beneficiary countries, with critical infrastructure (veterinary posts, vaccination pens) being upgraded primarily in underserved pastoral areas. Component 2: Sustainable landscape management and governance enhancement The main outcomes of Component 2 will be an increased area under sustainable landscape management and stronger governance of pastoral lands and livestock mobility, in compliance with agro-silvo-pastoral laws. Building on the legacy of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will further secure mobility and enhance access to natural resources (Subcomponent 2.1); finance the construction, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of essential water infrastructure (Subcomponent 2.2); and support fodder production (Subcomponent 3.3). These activities will enhance the resilience of (agro)pastoralists to climate risks and—by improving grazing management and livestock productivity—will improve soil carbon sequestration and reduce livestock emission intensities to mitigate climate change and provide additional ecosystem services. To the extent possible, Project investments will be directed at well-targeted transhumance routes and key livestock mobility corridors at the local, national, and cross-border level, to ensure the geographic concentration of activities and enable dialogue between adjacent cross-border communities in support of peaceful transhumance and resource use. Component 3: Livestock value chain improvement The outcome of Component 3 will be improved pastoral livestock value chains (VCs), the facilitation of regional livestock trade, and better regional market integration. Building on the achievements of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will continue to fill gaps in strategic market infrastructure along regional trade routes (Subcomponent 3.1), strengthen the capacities of national and regional producers' organizations (Subcomponent 3.2), and support innovative solutions for developing livestock VCs through subproject financing (Subcomponent 3.3). Activities under Subcomponents 3.1 and 3.3 will be prioritized along key regional trade routes where animals convoyed by foot move across borders to supply growing demand from markets in coastal countries.Component 4: Social and economic inclusion improvement, women and youth The outcome of Component 4 will be increased resilience as a result of expanding the socio-economic inclusion of (agro)pastoralists, particularly women and youth. PRAPS-1 successfully supported inclusion by improving access to skills training and technical and vocational training, and through direct support for the development of income-generating activities (IGAs). The proposed Project will provide continuity for these interventions by expanding access to technical and vocational training (Subcomponent 4.1) and IGAs (Subcomponent 4.3), focusing on a more structured approach for targeting young people and women. PRAPS-2 will also open a new area of work to promote the inclusion of pastoral populations in social and civil registries (Subcomponent 4.2). Component 5: Project coordination, institutional strengthening, crisis prevention and response Component 5 will focus on all aspects of Project management, including fiduciary management, safeguards, monitoring and evaluation, and communication (under Subcomponent 5.1). It will also support the development of institutional capacity (through adapted training as well as pastoral crisis prevention tools and procedures) and fill important knowledge and data gaps at the national and regional level (Subcomponent 5.2). The Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) will allow countries to respond swiftly to eligible crises or emergencies (Subcomponent 5.3).",[],[],['livestock'],[],[],"['animal health', 'grazing', 'livestock', 'pastoral', 'ruminant', 'silvopastoral', 'vaccination', 'veterinary', 'veterinary services']","['animal health', 'grazing', 'livestock', 'pastoral', 'ruminant', 'silvopastoral', 'vaccination', 'veterinary', 'veterinary services']"

The project will run for five years (2022-2027), with a total budget of US$180 million, which will be provided on full grant terms. Geographic coverage. DRDIP II will operate in the six main refugee-hosting regions (Afar, Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambella, Somali and Tigray), covering 30 woredas (districts) and 330 kebeles (wards). Expanding the scope of Phase I, it will include one additional region (Amhara), 14 new woredas/city administrations, 213 new kebeles and the 25 refugee camps/sites. Phase I of the Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP), which commenced in 2016 and will close in December 2022, has pioneered the long-term, government-led development response to forced displacement in Ethiopia. It has demonstrated the feasibility of such approaches in addressing negative impacts of the refugee presence while building on the opportunities it also presents. Phase II will build on the successes of the first phase while evolving to adapt to the progressive changes in the Government of Ethiopia's policy and legal framework for refugee inclusion. At the same time, Phase II will adjust activities and institutional arrangements to respond to a more challenging operational context, which has been affected by COVID-19, floods, locusts, drought and violent conflict. Major new design features for Phase II include: (a) refugees as direct beneficiaries. This will strengthen opportunities for durable solutions and help the government to meet its refugee inclusion policy commitments, including those articulated in the Global Compact on Refugees; (b) expanded geographic scope to cover all communities affected by the refugee presence, including in and around camps and sites established since DRDIP I began; (c) deeper support to help the government implement policy commitments on refugee inclusion through capacity-building and whole-of-government policy dialogue on refugee inclusion for the peak government agency on refugee affairs, Refugees and Returnees Services (RRS); (d) support for local development planning that integrates refugee concerns. ET-DRDIP II will support coordinated planning and engagement at the humanitarian-development nexus between the local administrations and actors working on the refugee response. Incorporating refugees in the kebele, woreda and regional development plans will make a tangible contribution to the transformation of the current humanitarian-focused refugee response model into a more sustainable and long-term development approach, as envisaged by the GCR; (e) enhanced focus on women's social and economic empowerment: Phase II will increase targets for female livelihood beneficiaries. Through a new sub-component on women's leadership and voice, it will train 12,000 women to lead community development committees established under the project and support gender-based violence prevention; and (f) social cohesion and inclusion. The project will include a new sub-component on social cohesion and inclusion to strengthen collaboration between refugees and host communities to underpin better social relations. Implementation using the CDD approach. Activities will continue to be implemented using the CDD approach, which is a proven mechanism for delivering cost-efficient, high quality, community-based infrastructure for better service delivery and livelihood support in remote, conflict-affected areas in Ethiopia and globally. CDD gives communities control over development resources and decision-making. Under DRDIP II, the local government will support beneficiaries to assess the existing development situation and identify needs and priority investments. The assessment will be captured in a community development plan that will be harmonized with kebele and woreda plans and humanitarian response plans in refugee settings. The project will help the community to form committees to implement their subprojects in collaboration with the local government. Component One: Social and economic services and infrastructure (US$83.6 million)This component will finance interventions to improve access to basic social services and economic infrastructure while building institutional capacities for local development planning and implementation. Support will also be provided to enhance women's leadership and voice and social cohesion and inclusion between refugees and host communities. The component will address service delivery gaps in the target areas, which have been exacerbated by the refugee presence and impacts of the conflict. Focusing on basic services such as education, health and water supply and sanitation, infrastructure will be built in an energy- and resource-efficient manner to help mitigate climate change impacts and support adaptation. Subprojects will be accessible to persons with disabilities (PWDs) and will address potential risk for gender-based violence (GBV) through safety audits. The component comprises four sub-components, as described below.Sub-component 1(a): Community Investment Fund (CIF) & Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) (US$79.6 million)The interventions under this sub-component will include support for social services (schools, water and sanitation, human and animal health facilities, etc.) and economic infrastructure (feeder roads, market centers, storage facilities, etc.). A total of 602 subprojects (544 CIF and 58 SIF) will be completed across the six project regions, benefiting 2.5 million people (1.76 million host community/740,000 refugees), 50 percent of whom will be women. Community Investment Fund (CIF) (US$68.0 million). Each of the 213 Phase II target kebeles and 25 refugee camps/sites will receive two funding cycles of up to US$125,000 for CIF subprojects. Kebeles within an eight-kilometer radius of a refugee camp or site (of which there are 68) will receive a third CIF round, for which subprojects can be located either in or outside the camp/site, based on a joint refugee-host community planning process. Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) (US$11.6 million ). With a ceiling of US$200,000, SIF subprojects operate beyond the needs of individual kebeles and, hence, will target the common and strategic needs of an entire woreda or a cluster of kebeles within a given woreda. Each of the 30 target woredas will receive a maximum of two SIF rounds, for a total of 58 subprojects. Sub-component 1(b): Capacity-building for local planning & decentralized service delivery (US$2 million )This sub-component will build community and local government capacity for planning and service delivery. At the community/kebele level, this will include support for different committees responsible for subproject identification, implementation and accountability, including Kebele Development Committees, Community Project Management Committees, Social Audit Committees, Community Procurement Committees, Community Facilitation Teams and Grievance Redress Committees. At the woreda level, capacity support includes training for local authorities and sector institutions on decentralized local development planning and implementation, strengthening for the woreda technical and appraisal committees and provision of field materials.Sub-component 1(c): Women's leadership and voice (US$1 million)This sub-component will strengthen women’s leadership and participation in the community institutions responsible for project planning and implementation, while also supporting GBV prevention.

Their ecosystems support a rich biological diversity with a high proportion of endemic species and therefore constituting number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Red Sea has been identified as a potential climate refuge for coral reefs, because of the relatively higher resilience of its corals compared to other parts of the world and also supports extensive seagrass beds and mangroves, which are all important for the sustainability of fisheries. The Gulf of Aden has levels of biological productivity that are amongst the highest in the world. The flow of nutrient rich water from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea is largely responsible for higher productivity in the southern part of the Red Sea. Marine fishery, as a traditional economic activity, remains a main source of food and income for coastal communities in the region. However, declining and fluctuating trends are reported for several fish species, which are mainly linked to degradation of their essential coastal habitats and overfishing. Other significant issues such as habitat destruction, overexploitation of marine resources; navigation risks, threats of hydrocarbon/chemical spills and illegal disposal of pollutants by transiting vessels, pollution from urban, industrial and tourism hotspots, and the impacts of climate change to the long-term stability of these waters stem from the increase in the human population in the coastal areas and the rapid economic growth resulting in considerable pressure on the coastal and marine environments.Managing fisheries these transboundary fishery resources in RSGA are critical to realize the opportunities to contribute to the participating countries’ economies and to address challenges of reduced fish production and loss of markets, inability to benefit from fishery resources economically and socially and related negative consequences on poor people that depend on them. This proposed Program on Sustainable Fishery Development in RSGA region (SFISH) will (i) supporting regional mechanism for collaborative management of fisheries in the RSGA region developed and adopted by the PERSGA member states sustainably managing this shared resource; and (ii) in Yemen, improve the management of the fishery value chain, thus enhancing the country’s food security and coastal livelihoods. It will do so through the use of an integrated approach that combines: (i) support in strengthening the institutional capacity and data systems at the regional and country levels, fishermen (and their associations and cooperatives, private sector and other stakeholders); (ii) investments in restoration, key inputs and infrastructure for fish production, processing, quality assurance and marketing in participating countries; and (iii) a flexible design approach, able to adapt to the changing needs resulting from the ongoing conflict in Yemen and other risks in the region, as well as other regional countries to participate in the future.

The first pillar of this Development Policy Financing (DPF) supports the fiscal recovery of Goias through the adoption of a spending cap, by consolidating spending on pensions, and the adoption of a medium-term fiscal adjustment plan. Goias is in the process of adopting a strong set of fiscal reforms and is committing to additional targets to ensure a fiscal recovery. An expenditure ceiling rule will help contain recurrent spending growth. A pension reform that increases the minimum retirement age and increases the contribution rate is expected to reduce the pension deficit by almost 20 percent. With these reforms, the DPF will help Goiás in becoming eligible for the federal government’s fiscal adjustment instrument for states (named “Fiscal Recovery Regime” - FRR), building further on the expected results of this DPF. The FRR places Goias under a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to improve its creditworthiness in the medium-term, increase its access to credit and federal guarantees, and improve the profile of its debt portfolio through additional fiscal consolidation measures. It thus enables this stand-alone DPF to contribute to keeping the State’s public finances on track in the medium-term.

Kenya has witnessed strong economic growth and declining poverty incidence, but absolute poverty remains high. Since 2011, the economy has experienced robust GDP growth averaging 5.0- percent, catapulting Kenya to a middle-income status and significantly bringing down poverty levels. Kenya’s poverty rate is among the lowest in East African countries, at 33.4 percent in 2019. Poverty reduction in Kenya has been accompanied by reduced income inequality, with the Gini index falling from 0.45 in 2005/06 to 0.39 in 2015/16. Kenya’s Human Development Index for 2019 is 0.601, which put the country in the medium human development category and it’s the World Bank Human Capital Index of 0.55 for 2020 places Kenya third in Sub-Saharan Africa.2. Recently revised national accounts estimates have altered agriculture’s share of nominal GDP down to 21.2 percent in 2019, down from an earlier estimate of 34.1 percent. However, despite the lower GDP contribution, movement of employment from agriculture to other sectors stalled between 2016 and 2019, and then accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the sector absorbed 1.6 million additional workers, increasing its share of employment from 47 percent to 54 percent. Sectoral and Institutional Context.3. The agriculture sector continues to be central to long term economic growth and sustainable poverty reduction in Kenya, with growth of 4.8 percent in 2020, and employing nearly 8.5 million Kenyans, or 70 percent of rural employment. Between 2005-06 to 2015-16, households with agriculture as the primary source of income accounted for 27.6 percent of overall poverty reduction . Agriculture accounted for up to 65 percent of exports in 2017 when its share of value-added peaked at the highest level among Kenya’s regional and Sub-Saharan Africa Lower Middle Income Country peers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, strong performance of the agriculture sector significantly cushioned the blow to the Kenyan economy.4. With predominantly smallholder-based agriculture production and its associated challenges, productivity levels for major crops in Kenya are stagnating. Kenya’s agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) had decline by at least ten percentage points between 2006 and 2013 and stabilized thereafter. Kenya’s TFP growth in agriculture lags Rwanda, Ethiopia and Tanzania and South Asia and South-East Asian countries . Small-scale production systems (between 0.2 and 3 ha) account for 78 percent of total agricultural production and 70 percent of commercial production. Hampered by poor access to credit and extension services, these production systems use limited improved inputs and modern production practices, such as hybrid seeds, concentrated feeds and fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, and irrigation. This is reflected in the value added per worker which has remained relatively stagnant between 2006-2016 and lags best-in-class countries in Africa by up to seven times. 5. Access to credit is a major constraint driving low adoption of quality inputs and technologies. Lending to the agriculture sector has generally stayed below 5 percent of total lending with annual credit needs across key commodity chains estimated at Ksh 130 billion compared to only Ksh 40 billion available. Having access to a farmer’s credit group in the community is associated with high usage rates of inorganic fertilizer to make productivity gains. But while financial inclusion in Kenya has tripled in 13 years with 83 percent of Kenyans having a formal bank account but only 22 percent being financially healthy to invest in economic opportunities . And in 2019, only 5 percent of the 4.2 million local farmers reported having received or made farm related payments digitally. 6. In addition to input and credit challenges, there is need to address inefficient value chains and low levels of value addition. Major value chains in Kenya are riddled by inefficiencies, including limited post-harvest handling infrastructure, inefficient price discovery mechanisms leading to low farmgate prices and high levels of food wastage. In 2017, over 1.9 million tons of food was wasted to post-harvest losses, while Kenya was facing a severe drought . Small farms continue to produce 73.0 percent of total marketed production, most of which goes to the market without any value addition . Only 16 percent of Kenya’s agricultural exports are processed, compared with 57 percent for imports. There is potential to significantly ramp up value addition across several agriculture and livestock value chains to boost producer incomes while generating new jobs.7. Kenya’s agriculture growth faces significant climate change risks that are expected to intensify in the coming decades. Kenya’s average annual temperatures have increased by 1°C between 1960 and 2003, and by 1.5 °C in the drier parts of the country. These rising temperatures have led to increasingly erratic climatic patterns and a general decline of rainfall in the main season. With 98 percent of agriculture being rainfed, the sector and especially smallholder farmers are extremely vulnerable to such shocks. The economic cost of floods and droughts is also estimated to create long-term fiscal liabilities of 2 to 2.8 percent of GDP each year . Future climate change is expected to bear heavily on Kenya’s food and nutritional security with yield reductions of 40- 45 percentexpected for maize, rice, soyabean, coffee and tea by 2100, and increases in food prices of 75 to 90 percent by 2055. The agricultural sector is also the largest source (59 percent) of total GHG emissions in Kenya with livestock-related emissions accounting for more than 96 percent of those emissions. Kenya still lags significantly in climate change mitigation and adaptation, ranked Kenya 148 out of 192 countries for readiness to adapt to climate change. Building climate resilient agriculture value chains requires transition to systems that are more productive, use inputs more efficiently, and have greater stability in outputs.8. Poverty incidence among agriculture households decreases as they start selling produce in markets yet multiple barriers exist to agriculture commercialization for small-holder farmers in Kenya. Only 26 percent of market-oriented households are poor as compared to 38 percent of subsistence households. Market participating households have higher usage of inorganic fertilizers and irrigation, spend significantly higher on inputs and exhibit higher crop diversity. In Kenya, lack of high-capacity farmer organizations limits small-holder integration into value chains, raising transaction costs and reducing competitiveness. Critical infrastructure gaps include limited availability of processing facilities close to farm gate to reduce post-harvest losses, limited access to cold storage and warehousing facilities that can reduce distress sales and lack of market infrastructure that can reduce the distance from producer to end consumer. Going forward, any sustainable agriculture growth strategy must place a strong focus on aggregation, commercialization and enhancing market participation for farmers esp. subsistence farmers, while boosting productivity through improved access to quality inputs and extension services. 9. Under the Agriculture Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS), the authorities have initiated several forward-looking reforms to improve the enabling environment for market driven interventions and greater private sector participation in Kenyan agriculture. One key policy reform has been transforming its delivery mechanism of subsidized inputs through e-vouchers, that has enabled farmers to purchase ad choose source and type of inputs from private sector dealers with better targeting and electronic verification. GoK has also enacted a new Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) Act paving the way for a large-scale warehouse receipt system which can improve small-holder access to credit, choice to store",[],[],['livestock'],[],[],"['livestock', 'processing', 'smallholder']","['livestock', 'processing', 'smallholder']"

The country, as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), is home to 8 of the 200 ecoregions recognizedworldwide, with 21 times more plant species per square kilometer than in Brazil, and a greater number of vertebrate species thanany other country in Central America and the Caribbean. According to the National Strategy for Biodiversity 2018-2050, the NationalProtected Areas System (SINAP) comprises 120 protected areas (PAs), 12 wildlife zones, and a variety of ecosystems, which togetheraccount for 31.8 percent of the country's land surface and 13.5 percent of the country's marine areas. Approximately 12 percent ofthe Panamanian population inhabits forested areas of the country and two-thirds of the country’s forest cover are in indigenouspeoples’ traditional territories, which include both indigenous territory and PAs, comprising some of Panama’s richest naturalresources and cultural diversity. The Panamanian territory plays an important role in the natural connectivity south of the MBC andnorthern South America, as it has played in different geological times. Biodiversity is of paramount importance not only due to theenvironmental good and services it provides, but also because an estimated 45 percent of the global economy is based on biologicalproducts and processes (World Tourism Organization, 2011). Rural inhabitants under clear land planning principles and a propergovernance structure are at the core for the preservation of Panama’s natural capital which is of national and global significance.Growth in world population has led to increased demands for greater supplies of food, causing one of the main drivers for GHGemission, biodiversity loss, and land degradation when unproperly managed. Biodiversity conservation relies on, inter alia,creating the opportunities to reduce the pressure affecting PAs. Better economic opportunities must be created for those ruralinhabitants trapped in poverty, which currently results in the need of expanding the agricultural frontier with unsustainableproductive systems that are fragmenting the ecosystem to improve their livelihoods. This scenario threatens to amplify a viciouscycle over the rural economy that could result in major threats to the SINAP. From 2006 to 2012, a total of 65,250 hectares weredeforested, of which 89 percent (58,309 hectares) were converted to areas for agricultural activities, with cattle farmingaccounting for most (45,542 hectares) of the deforested areas. The balance between forest gains and losses continues to be negativeover the period 2012-2019, with a loss of 56,369 hectares. Recent studies indicate that connectivity for most large terrestrialmammals is low in the Panamanian portion of the MBC, particularly forest in Darien, Donoso-Santa Fe, and La Amistad National Park,leading to habitats fragmentation as a primary driver of wildlife loss (Meyer, et al., 2019). Infrastructure development speciallyto create connectivity between Central and South America may threaten the natural habitats remaining and leave patches of naturalvegetation increasing biodiversity loss. Additionally, mining exploration and exploitation, hydroelectric projects, and the openingof rural roads and pathways are also part of the main drivers of deforestation, forest degradation and natural habitatfragmentation. Complicating the rural development challenge is the fact that Panama’s rural economy is highly exposed to thecombined effects of extreme weather events and climate change. The annual cost of disaster impacts is estimated to range from US$125 to 150 million (0.36 percent to 0.42 percent of GDP), which would have significant effects on long-term economic growth.Extreme weather events - intense storms, floods, and droughts - are negatively and more regularly affecting the livelihoods ofpeople living in lagging regions, predominantly women, Indigenous people and Afro-descendants. Evidence is accumulating that theincreasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events are attributable to climate change, which threatens to underminePanama’s unique biodiversity, the sustainability of agri-food systems, and the ability of the rural families to be food- andnutrition-secure, diversify, and improve their livelihoods (Panama Climate Risk and Adaptation Country profile). Climate changehas, and will continue to, adversely affect biodiversity at the genetic, species and ecosystem level. The majority of ecosystems inthe Americas have already experienced increased mean and extreme temperatures and/or precipitation which have, for example, causedchanges in species distributions and ecosystem boundaries. The main impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and marine species are theshift in their geographic ranges, and changes in seasonal activities, migration patterns and abundances (Bustamante, et al., 2018).The proposed operation aims at building institutional capacity and leveraging the activities that drive the rural economy toultimately improve the management of PAs containing biodiversity of vital importance. Building institutional capacity andcoordination of the public and private stakeholders will be essential for the operation to mainstreaming biodiversity into incomegeneration initiatives and towards a more systematic agenda for the sustainable use of the country’s natural resources. The projectwill promote sustainable and environmentally friendly investments to reduce biodiversity losses, particularly for the pooresthouseholds in the country, mostly located in Indigenous and Afro-descendants territories. As main driver of potential biodiversitylosses, both agriculture and tourism and their linkages will be the main entry points for the operation’s objective to contributeto a sustainable dynamization of Panama’s rural economy. The operation will promote the early engagement with the private sector,local communities and governments as critical partner to embrace and co-finance the proposed approach to maximize the impact of theGlobal Environment Facility (GEF) allocation. The integration of biodiversity with the agricultural and tourisms sectors willcontribute to reduce biodiversity loss giving value to the natural capital and the reinforcement of the natural assets to valuenature will be the focus. The core benefit of the project would be in favor of the protected areas and the conservation of thebiodiversity. The direct beneficiaries will include primarily (i) Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities, family farmers,producer cooperatives, small size entrepreneurs in project areas; and (ii) key public institutions -Ministry of Environment,Ministry of Agricultural Development, and the National Tourism Authority- and their civil servants would also directly benefit fromcapacity building interventions of the project. In addition, indirect beneficiaries will include those benefiting from the improvedbiodiversity management, stronger rural economy and better institutional services. Women and youth will be supported under allcomponents. The project is organized in three components: Component 1 (C1) will support institutional strengthening for land-useplanning and reinforce the skills to promote knowledge management and dissemination for the protection of the country naturalcapital. This will be done by (a) nature-based landscape vision and (b) knowledge for environmental management. The component willfacilitate technical and financial support to activities that integrate biodiversity into the public institutions and strengthennational in these environmental institutions, public policies, partner entities, local governments, and a more active participationof the private sector and communities in the conservation of biodiversity, particularly in the IPs and Afro-descendants territories(inclusive conservation).

Launched in April 2019, NPHP seeks to build five million low-cost housing units in urban areas across the country within a five-year timeframe. Access to land with secure tenure is a basic requirement for sustainable and affordable housing. Although information on urban property transactions is typically recorded through the registration of deeds, a standardized methodology for transaction processing does not exist in the urban areas of Punjab. Given the existing gaps and the absence of a standardized system of recording property rights in urban areas, the following challenges persist: (i) property tax evasion and inequitable taxation; (ii) non-availability of formal ownership records; (iii) lengthy dispute resolution and litigation processes; (iv) overlapping record registries in multiple agencies that lack harmonization; (v) lack of easy access to property rights information for development authorities to fulfill their core functions; and (vi) absence of up-to-date cadastral data for government agencies to incorporate climate change considerations. Women in urban areas also face marginalization and the loss of inheritance rights to land due to the lack of clarity on property ownership, limited access to land-related services, and cultural restrictions. As such, the Project will support the creation of a province-wide digital cadastral map, standardization and interlinking land records, data improvement in urban and rural areas, the scale-up of Land Record Management and Information System (LRMIS), as well as project management and policy development.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and policies to limit its spread, the Kyrgyz economy remains in a deep recession following a contraction of8.6 percent in 2020. The Gross National Income per capita was US$1,160 in 2020, which is slightly above the threshold for Lower Middle-Income Country status. The country has a population of about 6.6 million with over 60 percent living in rural areas. The COVID-19 crisis threatens to undo the gains in poverty reduction achieved over the past few years, and a high proportion of the population risks falling back into poverty. The COVID-19 crisis has adversely impacted labor income and remittances, and this, combined with inflation, leaves large segments of the population exposed to the economic consequences of the pandemic. The poverty rate was 20 percent in 2019, and a further 65 percent of the population was considered vulnerable to poverty. The poverty rate in the Kyrgyz Republic increased by 11 percentage points from 20.1 percent in 2019 to 31 percent in 2020, pushing an additional 700,000 people into poverty – a very large absolute increase for a population of 6.6 million. The country is going through a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. With a slow rate of mass vaccination (14.5 percent of the total population since the start of vaccination) and a failure to follow stringently social distancing and sanitary requirements by the majority of the population, the daily cases of newly infected have started to increase since March 2021 (around 45 cases, measured as a 7-day moving average) and peaked to 353 cases in May 2021. The total number of infected people since the outbreak of the pandemic has reached 105,111 and death tolled 1,815 people as of May 31, 2021. Global economic factors and especially the economic slowdown in Kazakhstan and Russia will exacerbate the economic shock from COVID-19 to the Kyrgyz economy. The pandemic has already affected food prices, the availability of medicines and medical supplies, employment and the remittance flow. This latter point is particularly important given the economy’s dependence on remittances (27 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)).The regional and spatial analysis report, prepared by the Bank in 2019, has identified southern regions as the most lagging in the country. The country’s large urban-rural and intraregional disparities in the incidence of poverty highlight the economic dualism in the country and remote and mountainous regions bearing the highest-burden of poverty. To help the Government address the issues of regional disparities, in March 2020, the Bank approved US$60 million of International Development Association (IDA) financing for the Regional Economic Development Project (RED-1) designed to support one of the country’s key lagging regions – Osh – and to enhance its economic development through targeted interventions in the selected economic sectors. The selection of Osh as the pilot region for the first regional economic development operation was based on a regional and spatial analysis, which showed Osh as one of the key lagging regions despite its abundant assets and potential. This same analysis also identified the Batken region as the second lagging region characterized by high poverty and vulnerability. Batken’s Gross Regional Product per capita in 2019 was only 40 percent of the national average and only neighboring Osh oblast was lower. The unemployment rate at the regional level remains the highest in the country at 10 percent and is expected to grow in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as more migrants are expected to return to their homes. Infrastructure and the provision of basic municipal services also put Batken among the poorest regions. As of 2019, out of the country’s seven regions, Batken had the country’s highest poverty rate amounting to 32.6 percent, while the national average was 20.1 percent. Batken’s already high poverty level would be even higher without remittances. As a 2019 study showed, remittances have provided an essential safety net in Batken, as the regional poverty rate would be around 50 percent without remittances. This confirms the population's extreme vulnerability to poverty and heavy dependence on remittances. More sustainable poverty reduction will require local economic growth which results in sustainable and socially inclusive development. The poor need greater access to services, water and sanitation, employment, credit, and markets for produce. Batken is facing similar challenges as the Osh region, including low skilled labor, low level of enterprise development, low market accessibility, and low level of development of relevant economic institutions, infrastructure, and services. As of 2019, nearly 80 percent of households lack access to safe drinking water and almost the entire population lacked access to safe sewage systems. Other public services, such as schools and kindergartens also remained a challenge. Analysis of accessibility shows that the main cities - Isfana, Batken, and Kadamjay - are isolated from, rather than integrated with each other, thus limiting the positive role they can play in terms of linking to rural areas, linking to each other, and linking to the rest of the country.The growing population in the region offers a great opportunity for development, but it also signifies increased demand for employment, infrastructure, and basic urban services. The demand for infrastructure and services is further challenged by the aging infrastructure inherited from the old Sovie t system, low capacity of the current service delivery system to keep up with the growth, energy inefficiencies, and high costs in relation to housing, public buildings, and municipal services, low level of tariffs and cost recovery, heavy reliance on public funds and limited capacity to leverage public investments to mobilize private capital. A lack of reliable municipal services and infrastructure is one of the main obstacles to nurturing private sector development.Batken is part of the Ferghana Valley whose agri-food products have considerable market potential. Fresh fruits and vegetables are the most common Kyrgyz agricultural exports, comprising around 14 and 41 percent respectively of the US$260 million agri-food exports of the country. There has been increased demand for high-value agricultural products and food, driven by rising population incomes in Kazakhstan, China, and Russia. However, most Kyrgyz agri-food enterprises are small-scale producers (many informal), including those that export. They are generally not competitive, struggle to access markets and technology, and face difficulties in attracting investments and creating jobs. Hence, three key strategies to improve the situation are expanding markets, linking farmers with markets, and creating an enabling environment.The proposed Second Regional Economic Development (RED-2) project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity as well as with the current Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2019-2022. The project will improve infrastructure and livability, diversification of economic opportunities, increase border trade and exports, and enhance regional and local potential, thereby contributing towards reducing poverty and shared prosperity.

Even though its share of total GDP has decreased over the last decade, agriculture retains a crucial role in economic growth in The Gambia. The sector contributes around 20 percent of GDP and generates 30 percent of all foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for 80 percent of the rural population, the sector employs nearly half—46 percent—of the country’s labor force, including an estimated 72 percent of the poor and 91 percent of the extreme poor. Agriculture in the Gambia is dominated by subsistence-oriented rainfed crop and livestock production systems. The performance of the agri-food sector has been poor and erratic. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) classifies the Gambia as “a Low-Income Food Deficit Country” facing severe food security issues at both household and national levels. The COVID-19 pandemic will worsen the country food and nutrition insecurity situation. However, agriculture and agribusiness could become robust engines of inclusive growth and job creation. The country has the potential to achieve huge gains in productivity and market share, given its rich natural resource endowment and strong domestic, regional, and international demand for its agricultural products, including rice, groundnuts, cashews, vegetables, and fruits. The design of the proposed project supports The Gambia in transforming the agricultural sector into a competitive and resilient commercial agri-food sector. This transformative change will be achieved through a logical chain of activities: (i) improving the enabling environment for agriculture/agribusiness development by expanding access to markets for producers and SMEs (through better logistics, market infrastructure, critical SPS services, and access roads), improving the policy and institutional framework, and strengthening the coordination and efficiency of value chain actors; (ii) increasing the productivity and competitiveness of producers and SMEs, as well as their resilience to climate change, by expanding access to climate-smart technologies, inputs, and services; and (iii) increasing private investment along the value chains by strengthening the key public and private institutions responsible for promoting and mobilizing private investment and by providing support services (technical, managerial, and financial) to agribusiness operators. The World Bank Group (WBG) Gambia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2021–26 (under preparation) and recently completed Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), “Overcoming a No-Growth Legacy,’’ fully support the national vision and objectives for the agricultural sector. The three CPF Focus Areas recognize that The Gambia can transition out of fragility only by addressing its underlying public service delivery challenges, tackling constraints on development in key economic sectors such as agriculture, and investing in human capital. The proposed project is an integral part of CPF Focus Area 2, which aims to Enable Inclusive and Resilient Private Sector Driven Job Creation through sustained support for government efforts to create an enabling business environment that fuels job creation, by boosting commercial agriculture and increasing access to finance for MSMEs, among other actions.The project will contribute to the achievement of the WBG’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as well as the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of no poverty and zero hunger by 2030. Like other African countries, Gambia—if it is to meet the twin WBG goals and realize the SDGs—must achieve economic growth that is transformational, sustained, inclusive, and pro-poor, capable of lifting the poor one million Gambians, most of whom live in rural areas and depend on agriculture as their main source of livelihood, above the poverty threshold.",[],['smallholder'],[],[],[],['livestock'],"['livestock', 'smallholder']"

This instrument will allow to tackle complex development challenges underpinning food system resilience for two principle reasons: (1) to guarantee the longer term commitment required to build sustainable regional mechanisms and institutions with sufficent substance at a regional level and (2) to allow a set of countries with varying degrees of readiness to adopt consistent approaches and accede to regional systems at appropriately differential speeds. Phasing the accession of countries according to their readiness will allow regional mechanisms to operate with maximum effectiveness. Phase I of the MPA includes: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo. Each component will be led by a mandated regional institution to ensure coordination and build lasting capacity.The project will include the following five components and six sub-components:Component 1: Digital Advisory Services for Agriculture and Food Crisis Prevention & Management. This component aims at (i) strengthening regional capacity and institutional sustainability to provide demand-driven digital advisory services including agro-advisory and impact-based hydromet/climate information and warning services and (ii) promote their use in agriculture and food crisis prevention, management and response • Regional Sub-component 1.1: Upgrading Food Crisis Prevention & Monitoring Systems. The sub-component would transform the regional system for food security relevant data collection, analysis and management in order to information and advisory services through strengthening the capabilities, coordination and organization of AGRHYMET and other institutions mandated to fulfil these functions at regional level.• National Sub-component 1.2: Strengthening Creation and Provision of Digital Advisory Services for Farmers The sub-component would increase access to and use of location-specific information relevant to food security by decision makers and farmers via national extension systems, including through capacity building and institutional strengthening activities for public and private hydromet and agromet service providers.Component 2: Sustainability & Adaptive Capacity of the Food System’s Productive Base. This component targets the resilience of agro-sylvo-pastoral production systems allowing small and medium producers to sustainably meet their nutritional needs and raise incomes from the sale of surpluses in local and regional markets.• Regional Sub-component 2.1: Adapting and adopting Innovations and Technologies for Resilient Food Systems. This sub-component would aim to strengthen the regional research and extension systems to deliver and scale up, in a sustainable manner, improved technologies and innovation including digital agriculture, climate-smart, nutrition-sensitive, and gender- and youth-sensitive technologies. By linking up with the national level, this component would support the implementation of national action plans of modernizing national research and extension systems to accelerate farmer adoption of innovations and technologies. • National Sub-component 2.2: Building resilience in food security. This sub-component aims at improving sustainably rural households’ food security and their resilience to climate variability in targeted areas through using food crisis prevention tools developed under component 1, CSA technologies and innovations adapted under above sub-component 2.1 as well as through implementation of coordinated and complementary interventions that restore degraded landscapes and mobilize water resources. This sub-component will also consider implementation modalities to improve resilience to climate and FCV risks such as building and sustaining bottom-up, community-level dialogues. Component 3: Market Integration & Trade. The components’ objective is to expand food trade in West Africa to enable an effective allocation of surplus produce to deficit regions and to attract agribusiness investment by tackling binding constraints in the development of regional food crops value chains along selected trade corridors with high impact on smallholders’ food security.• Regional Sub-component 3.1: Facilitate Trade Across Key Corridors and Consolidate Food Reserve System. The Project will support the implementation of sound regional regulation and policies to strengthen the regional food input and output markets. Activities would focus on removing barriers to intra-regional cross-border food trade (e.g., through policy harmonization as well as establishing better trade flow monitoring, and accountability mechanisms) and strengthening the relevant regional institutions (ECOWAS, CILSS) responsible for coordinating the integration of regional markets as well as strengthening the regional and national food reserve management mechanisms.• National Sub-component 3.2: Value chain Development for Strategic Staple Crops. The project will support the development of up to three value chains per country focusing on staple crops that are already traded between countries. Specific activities would include the preparation and implementation of national VC action plans; matching grant support & TA for SMEs; and support to critical investments to leverage private financing along the value chains. Investments under this component would directly support the recovery from the COVID-19.Component 4: Contingent Emergency Response This component will allow for a reallocation of credit proceeds from other components to provide immediate emergency recovery support following an eligible crisis or emergency. An Emergency Response Manual (ERM) will be developed with fiduciary, safeguards, monitoring and reporting, and any other necessary coordination and implementation arrangements as a condition for disbursement.Component 5: Project management Project management would be coordinated by ECOWAS, which would delegate technical work to the relevant mandated organizations (principally AGRHYMET and CORAF). This component would aim at ensuring that the project is efficiently managed, and performance and impact are carefully tracked, including through supporting M&E and impact analysis; annual foresight conferences; productivity measurements.",[],[],['livestock'],[],[],['pastoral'],"['livestock', 'pastoral']"

The interrelationship among agriculture, biodiversity (including wildlife) conservation, mining, and forestry calls for a holistic integrated landscape approach to provide ecosystem services. Smallholder farmers’ access to finance also needs to be improved and critical supply chain bottlenecks removed in the value chains by focusing on improved storage and post-storage processing. Therefore, a win-win vision for the environment and regional economy is exploiting green drivers of growth compatible with improved watershed management, supported by appropriate commercial and social infrastructure. Tree crops are identified as a key economic driver. The potential for additional agricultural diversification and nature-based tourism needs to be supported for better resource management at the landscape level. Farm-based aquaculture is an important economic and food security activity, scaled up under the project additional financing. Uncontrolled illegal small-scale mining, including extraction of gold, sand winnowing, and stone quarrying, has resulted in serious deforestation and land degradation – requiring a meaningful effort to formalize and train small-scale miners in environmentally-smart mining as part of the landscape-wide management approach. This requires strong multi-sector coordination at both the national and decentralized levels. The Project is supporting cross-sectoral collaboration from a number of Government agencies, such as MEST, EPA, MOFA, MLNR, Ghana COCOBOD, Minerals Commission, Water Resources Commission, Fisheries Commission, and Forestry Commission to proactively engage in finding integrated solutions to landscape management.The GoG has requested broader engagement and support from the World Bank in addressing the small-scale mining sectoral issues in the targeted landscapes. The project is supporting a sequence of sector reform initiatives, including (a) regulatory reform and formalization of the ASM sector, (b) strengthening the government’s capacity for support and monitoring of small-scale mining operations. Subsequently, the project aims to support (c) piloting rehabilitation on a limited number of mined out sites (according to lessons learned from the just-closed Forest Investment Program project), (d) promoting responsible entrepreneurship for ASM development, and (e) supporting sustainable livelihood alternatives within galamsey communities. However, addressing the full scope of the artisanal and small-scale mining issues will require mobilization of additional resources on a much grander scale, both from Ghana’s own budget and from external partners and sources, beyond the scope of this project.The project design has a two-fold focus to: (i) enhance landscape management planning at decentralized levels that cuts across administrative boundaries, multiple sectors and multiple land uses in the target sub-basins within the savannah and cocoa forest areas. The actions envisaged through such planning will be mainstreamed into and implemented through GoG Mid-term development plans (at district-level) to ensure synergies with government-led development planning, and (ii) scale-up land use specific interventions for land restoration, and food and cash crops production linked to livelihoods, both in the Northern Savannah Zone and the cocoa forest landscape.",[],[],[],[],[],"['processing', 'smallholder']","['processing', 'smallholder']"

The Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) has adopted a five-year development strategy that significantly changes the role of the state in the economy to enable competitive markets, growth of the private sector, modernization of agriculture and investments in human capital. Improvements in financial inclusion, social protection and service delivery are also a focus of the reforms. The Government has recognized the need for new drivers of economic growth, income generation and job creation for long-term sustainability of socio- economic gains. To achieve its ambitious growth objectives, Uzbekistan will need to promote inclusive job growth at a much faster pace and more women and youth will need to join the labor force. The recent diagnostic on growth and job creation suggests that the GDP growth in Uzbekistan for the period of 1996-2016 was largely jobless and was fueled by an increase in productivity across sectors. However, some of these productivity gains were offset by falling employment rates. It is estimated that GDP grew at 12.5 percent less compared to the growth expected had the employment rates stayed constant. The job gap persists, and the latest data suggests that only 1.06 million jobs were added against an estimated need of more than 1.3 million jobs. This needs to be viewed in conjunction with significantly lower female labor force participation rates in Uzbekistan. About 56 percent of the population above 15 years was employed in 2017 (ILO) with a wide gender gap as the employment rate for men was 69 percent and 44 for women. The unemployment rate for women remains unchanged since 2007 at 8 percent which is almost equal to the unemployment rate for men of 8.5 percent[3]. Inactivity among women is more than double that for men at 48 percent for women and 22 percent for men. If female labor force participation in Uzbekistan equaled on average that of OECD countries, an additional 1.03 million women would be contributing to the economy. If parity were achieved with Russia, the figure would increase to 1.6 million. Rural women from low income households are at high risk of economic exclusion. The SCD has recognized that the economic exclusion of women is the largest social exclusion risk. There are structural barriers to women participation in the labor force and rural women from low income segments are particularly vulnerable. Women in the bottom 20 percent wealth quintile have the lowest employment rates amongst all Uzbek women. Only 37 percent of rural women attain education beyond secondary level as opposed to 49 percent of urban women which significantly affects the likelihood of as well as the sectors of employment. Women with vocational or tertiary education are predominantly employed in public sector jobs with formal wages while women educated up to secondary level or lower work in informal, unregulated, part-time, low paying jobs. Few working-age women participate in the formal labor force. Of those in the labor force, a much higher share is looking for work It is estimated that for rural women from low income families, cotton picking may contribute up to 30 percent of annual income. The ongoing modernization of the cotton sector will put further pressure on income generating opportunities for such women. Rural women in Uzbekistan face multiple barriers to entrepreneurship and employment—from social and cultural norms to access to finance and markets. Gender disparities in Uzbekistan manifest most strongly in women’s positions in the labor force and employment with social stereotypes having a profound impact on women’s access to opportunities and resources. Rural women face several barriers to participation in the job market. These include less education and skills as on average rural women (56 percent) have only a secondary education. Overall 66 percent of women in Uzbekistan with secondary education are inactive. Further constraints include the burden of domestic responsibilities, the bulk of which are shouldered by women; an expectation of being the sole caregiver and breadwinner when men migrate for work; limited availability and access to financial and business resources; low mobility and adoption of ICT; and lack of access to business networks that can mentor budding entrepreneurs. Rural women spend 45.9 percent of their free time on unpaid domestic work, compared to the 16.6 percent of a rural men’s time occupied by such activities. As a result, rural women, especially those in the reproductive age, have limited time for productive economic activities. The large-scale migration from rural areas for work outside the country mostly to Russia and Kazakhstan by men places a heavy burden on female-headed households. Limited access to affordable and high-quality childcare and pre-school services adversely affects women’s participation in the labor force. Currently, 60 percent of all pre-school facilities in Uzbekistan are in urban areas. Half of the population however lives in rural areas, which account for only 30 percent of total pre-school enrollments indicating a higher burden of childcare in rural areas. Fertility rates in rural areas are high, and local traditions encourage families to have many children. As a result, women spend about three times as much time providing care as men. Rural households cannot often afford the fees for these establishments. In December 2016, the GoU approved the Program for Further Improvement of the Preschool Education System from 2017 through 2021. Under the program, GoU is expanding pre-school infrastructure across the country through state-led initiatives as well as public-private partnerships. The initiative presents an opportunity to offer community based affordable and quality childcare services to boost female economic participation. The rural women’s enterprises planned under this project could be both service providers as well as primary beneficiaries of such facilities. A study in Turkey by UN Women in 2018 showed that investments in care could generate 2.5 times more jobs than in construction and 73 percent of these would go to women. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the vulnerabilities facing rural communities and women from low-income rural households due to the loss of income from remittances, employment, and other sources; increased domestic care responsibilities; and increased risk of domestic violence. In addition, recent analysis of data from the GoU’s Listening to the Citizens of Uzbekistan (L2CU) project shows that one-fifth of Uzbekistan’s households are headed by women and these female-headed households (FHHs) face additional vulnerabilities. Approximately half of female heads of household report having a disability compared to 30 percent of male-headed households (MHHs). Members of FHHs earn less than MHHs, are less likely to have employed household members, and generally have fewer sources of income than MHHs. FHHs are also more vulnerable to income fluctuations and economic shocks. Therefore, compared to MHHs, FHHs are almost twice as likely to be unable to pay for utilities and are more likely to reduce food consumption to meet basic needs. Although FHHs are slightly more likely than male headed households to report receiving support from GoU/official sources since the start of the pandemic, FHHs are less likely than male headed households to be able to pay for an emergency expense. The innovative design of the project integrates participatory approaches to community outreach and capacity building with the provision of financial and non-financial services that are tailored to the needs of women from low-income rural households.

Following a major security crisis in 2013 that displaced over 25 percent of its 4.9 million people, CAR has embarked on a long recovery process. However, despite the signing of a peace agreement in 2019, conflicts and violence continue to affect the country’s economic performance. Average GDP growth has been low and not inclusive over the past decades. Poverty remains pervasive with an estimated 71 percent of the population living below the international poverty line (US$ 1.90 per day, 2011 PPP) in 2019. Measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, including border closures and restrictions of movement within the country, have put additional strain on the already fragile economy. The COVID-19 crisis had a substantial effect on households’ purchasing power across the country. It also disrupted already fragile agricultural input supply chains, which is expected to reduce the availability of inputs necessary for the ongoing and forthcoming agriculture campaigns, which in turn could amplify local supply shocks due to reduced domestic production. In addition, heavy rains/flood and water scarcity/droughts become more frequent with climate change, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and causing human and economic losses. Severe flooding has further undermined food security by negatively affecting the output from the last cropping season and placing additional burden on already strained household income. As a result, an estimated 1.93 million people (41 percent of the population) currently face high acute food insecurity and this number is expected to increase to 2.31 million people (48 percent of the population) by August 2021. Further, it is estimated that 1.3 million people do not have enough food, 42.3 percent of children under 5 years are suffering from chronic malnutrition and 5.8 percent are in acute malnutrition. The magnitude and scale of the food crisis emergency in CAR have overwhelmed the response capacity of the government, whose narrow fiscal space is overstretched to deals with multiple crisis simultaneously. In view of the unmet needs in food and nutrition security, US$50 million is granted from the IDA Crisis Response Window (CRW) to help alleviate the situation. The proposed Emergency Food Crisis response is well aligned with the World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) in CAR for FY21–25, as well as with the WBG FCV Strategy. CAR is one of the most fragile countries in the world, where the risk of recurrence of conflict is higher if the level of food insecurity is high. Indeed, improved food security will help mitigate some of the spillovers of long years of conflict in the country.The project will be implemented through four components:Component 1: This component will support an accelerated supply response focused on restoring and preserving the productive capacity of farming households to enable continued and expanded production of key staple foods and livestock that is resilient to climate change.

This financing is considered critical to ensure continued government attention and ability to fully implement the reforms under the parent operation. Pillar 1: responding to COVID-19 to protect the vulnerable. The need to evacuate persons has increased the potential COVID-19 transmission risk as evacuees congregate in shelters. The authorities are implementing measures to focus testing and vaccination efforts on those within the shelters. Nonetheless, the risk of community infection transmission has increased, and increased pressure on public finances following the volcanic eruption constrains the GoSVG response. Pillar 2: strengthening fiscal resilience.

It constitutes 20 percent of the country’s GDP and provides jobs for about 61 percent of the population. Yet, it has largely remained subsistence and underdeveloped characterized by low productivity and limited use of improved technologies. The food sector is small and fragmented, contributing to large food and farm input imports. The country imports about 75 percent of food consumed and over 50 percent of the value of agricultural inputs, including seeds, seedlings, animal breeds, fertilizers, and farm machinery. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified development challenges exposing the poor performance of the agricultural sector and the weak early waring, preparedness and response system of pubic institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted migrant remittances and trade activities of the highly remittance dependent economy of Tajikistan thereby contributing to declining migrants’ transfers and ultimately to contracted household consumption. The proposed project will be centered around strengthening the resilience of Tajikistan’s agriculture by financing public institutions to deliver more and better services to farmers and agribusinesses. It aims at increasing domestic food self-reliance, strengthening the foundation for increased production and export competitiveness of the growing horticulture sector, and improving MoA’s and other relevant pubic institutions’ early warning, preparedness and response capacity. The project also aims at enhancing public institutions’ strategic engagement with private sector by supporting the the development of a viable sector of private micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in rural areas and generate employment opportunities in regions with few legal alternatives. . The geography of the project activities will be nationwide. The project aims to achieve these by financing following components: Component 1: Strengthen seed, seedling and planting material systems: The objective of this component is to support the development of a vibrant system for seed, seedling, and planting materials, which contributes to increased availability and use of new, improved and farmer-preferred seeds, seedlings and planting materials. The approach to be followed in supporting the development of vibrant seed/seedling sector by the proposed project is the Integrated Seed Sector Development approach. This approach will enable to address bottlenecks in the seed/seedling value chain across various seed systems, including formal and informal, private and public, etc. The activities for this component will be country wide, and this component will support: (i) Enabling environment (ii) Research and development (iii) Multiplication (iv) Quality assurance Component 2: Support investments in agri-logistics to enhance horticulture value chains: The objective of this component is to support investments in agri-logistical centers (ALCs) to enhance high-value horticulture value chains, so horticulture production becomes more competitive. The component will support investments for horticulture development initiated under ACP and REDP and derive lessons from similar investments in the neighboring Uzbekistan through investments in several agri-logistical centers, with options for public-private partnerships in their management and operation. These investments will generate climate co-benefits by promoting agricultural diversification towards horticulture, improving food distribution and food safety, reducing food loss and waste, and making construction climate proof and energy efficient. Location and design of these agri-logistical centers will be confirmed during preparation. (i) Support the development and operation of ALCs(ii) Capacity building for operation and management of ALCs and awareness raising Component 3: Build public capacity for crises prevention and management: The objective of this component is to strengthen the crisis prevention and management capacity of selected public institutions. The COVID-19 outbreak caught many by surprise, exposing weaknesses of the current early warning and agri-food sector monitoring and response capacity of the government. They could not provide reliable estimates of available food/inputs stocks and accurate forecasts for future harvests, causing food hoarding and heightened food price volatility. With amplified climate change, crises such as COVID-19 pandemic will occur even more often. The proposed project will strengthen selected/key public institutions for enhanced capacity, resilience and better early warning and response, plant protection and quarantine, and locust prevention/eradication, as well as sector planning, monitoring and evaluation through digitalization and capacity building. The support will include investments in digital and laboratory infrastructure of the MoA and other selected public agencies and institutions and capacity building for better early warning and agri-food sector monitoring as well as effective response. (i) Real-time monitoring of agricultural production, land use, and agrometeorology(ii) Soil fertility management (iii) Crop protection and locust control Component 4: Project management and coordination: This component will support project management, coordination, M&E, and implementation of safeguards and fiduciary aspects of the project.

This component will focus on supporting recovery in partially insecure communes and communities in so-called “orange zones”. It will mitigate further displacement by addressing the immediate needs of affected communities through the provision of goods, livelihood support and the rehabilitation of small-scale productive infrastructure. Eligible communities will be able to select from a closed menu of investments under this component to address emergency needs. It will generate income through LIPWs involving target communities. It is anticipated that this component will represent around 20 percent of total project investments. Security in target areas will be monitored continuously in order to adjust or suspend activities when required by circumstances. The activities under this component will generate useful field-level data and information that will feed into regional data collection and dialogue supported by Component 3. The regional data and dialogue on development issues in Liptako-Gourma will in turn inform adjustments to field activities. The component has two sub-components: Sub-Component 1a: Basic livelihood support and income-generating activities. This sub-component will focus on the short-term restoration of basic livelihood in conflict-affected areas and address the needs of target communities for economic resources. Activities under this sub-component include: - Provision of agricultural inputs such as seeds for local staple crops (maize, sorghum, beans and peas), fertilizer (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and urea) and manual tools, with an emphasis on climate-smart agricultural practices (for example, prioritizing drought-resistant crops); - Provision of livestock kits and animal feed to farmers/herders (i.e. sheep, goat and cattle); - Extension services such as short training courses (e.g. on climate resilient practices), including e-extension services where feasible; - Provision of livestock kits and extension services for poultry farming, aquaculture and fishing to promote livelihood diversification and improve food security; and - Targeted LIPW activities related to soil preservation and climate-resilient small water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as restoration works and regeneration of pasture lands to increase environmental protection and climate resilience. LIPW activities will generate well-needed income for target communities. Participants in LIPW activities will be selected through a public lottery selection system. Recruitment will be widely advertised. Eligible persons who would like to participate in the lottery for LIPW activities can register, subject to certain limits like distance to subproject sites, previous unemployment, one individual per household, and so on. Names drawn will then be written on two lists by gender, to ensure 50 percent of beneficiaries are female. Limits and/or prerequisites, which will be described in more detail in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM), will ensure that the most vulnerable (such as youth and females) are prioritized in the selection process for participating in LIPW activities. These activities will be accompanied by men’s sensitization and engagement interventions to encourage women’s participation. Selection mechanisms will also support prioritization of youths, displaced persons, and people with disabilities. The proposed method promotes a transparent, fair, and equal chance for all community members to benefit from the project, which is important in a context where trust in the Government is low and social capital has been weakened. In addition to generating income, the LIPW method can contribute to social inclusion and cohesion by (a) demonstrating that a large variety of works can be done by the community (even unskilled community members) and (b) allowing workers from different backgrounds and genders to work together. Keeping LIPW opportunities within target communities also mitigates potential risks of conflict with external laborers, who might be perceived as competing for limited new local income-generating opportunities.Sub-Component 1b: Delivery of household goods and small-scale infrastructure works in crisis-affected regions This sub-component will provide much-needed supplies to conflict-affected communities with moderate to substantial accessibility constraints. It will also support the rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure. The activities financed under this sub-component will include: - Provision of basic necessity kits, consisting of household supplies like solar lightening, rainwater harvesting kits, kitchen sets, mosquito nets, plastic mats, blankets, and hygiene kits etc.; - Rehabilitation and construction of climate-resilient water and sanitation structures; and - Rehabilitation of small-scale socio-economic infrastructure, via LIPW when applicable. Component 2: Transitional support towards stabilization and territorial development of communities This component will contribute to territorial development and stabilization in comparatively safer and more accessible communities in “yellow zones” (mostly in secondary cities and their surroundings), that host a large share of the forcibly displaced population. Investments will support communities’ access to socio-economic infrastructure and services, climate-resilient livelihoods, and environmental and natural resource management. Therefore, mitigating risks of increased competition for scarce resources. It will support host communities and forcibly displaced alike, as well as the communes’ local institutions. The component will deploy a community-centered approach by ensuring the representation and active participation of local communities in local development planning processes, the identification and prioritization of their needs, and the implementation and monitoring of project activities. These community-centered platforms will strengthen the social contract by providing mechanisms for communities to work with local governments to drive local investments. They will foster social resilience and support a territorial development approach where investments are tailored to the realities of local development challenges (including degree of community isolation, violence, and climate risks). Activities are organized into two sub-components, described below. Both community-level and municipal level investments will be supported, with implementation modalities adjusted according to the size of sub-projects and the area context. Both sub-components will use an open menu approach to ensure investments are responsive to local needs. This will also enable municipalities, communes and communities to pull resources together for larger inter-sector investments. Sub-Component 2a: Access to Resilient Socioeconomic Infrastructure and ServicesThis sub-component will finance local investments to (a) expand and improve local service delivery; and (b) build integrated infrastructure for local development and support regional integration and positive spillover impacts. The target communities and local governments will work together to identify and prioritize the specific social services and economic infrastructure to be funded through the yearly updating of LDPs.

Project-financed activities will be grouped into the following three components: Component 1: Piloting community – centered approach on dryland agroforestry and landscape restoration (US$2.46 million)Component 1 will finance grants (cash-for-work), technical assistance, goods and services, works, training and operational costs to conduct several key activities related to actual landscape restoration: (a) piloting of community-centered afforestation around Kyzylorda city using successful planting technologies of Saxaul and other drought-resistant trees; and (b) piloting of the farmer-centered approach in establishment of 3 agroforestry demonstration plots in Kyzylorda oblast (5 ha each) of fast-growing fruit tree plantations for combining forestry with fruit production and/or horticulture; and 6 plots in degraded pasturelands in Zhambyl oblast (20 ha each but affecting 1,300 ha of surrounding pastures) for combining forestry with livestock production. Sample agro-forestry practices based on existing recommendations will include plantation of fodder trees and pasture improvement. Various agro-forestry practices will be evaluated separately based on cost-benefit calculations and beneficiaries’ feedback and will be suggested for scale-up in other donor financed projects and/or government subsidized programs as well as farms’ self-financed investments. The project will also cover establishment of nursery and technical equipment necessary to conduct those operations. When possible, if stumps or seeds are present in the soil, also Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) will be added in the menu of options for restoration. Actions under (a) will be implemented by local forestry enterprises while hiring local community members to carry out the planting, plantations on pastureland will be carried out by the farmers supported by forestry organizations reporting to the local government, involving: (i) knowledge dissemination to farmers, farmers’ associations, and the national and local administration about the model and its benefits; (ii) developing markets and rewarding farmers for start-up time; (iii) conducting suitability assessments to identify the areas suitable for agroforestry, for FMNR, and the tree species to be used, and the conditions under which agroforestry or FMNR should be implemented; and (iv) providing local incentives to participating farmers, for example subsidized inputs. Component 2: Capacity building of the Forestry and Wildlife Committee (FWC) for integrated landscape management (US$1.38 million)This component will address FWC key bottlenecks to raise their afforestation capacity and support the evolving institutional needs of the forestry sector to become a sustainable and productive sector by financing critical capacity building activities including inter alia technical studies, consultations and surveys. Preparatory works including mapping, survey, and design will be made on Dry Aral Seabed, which should allow continued long-term afforestation of degraded area. The project will also support establishment of a depository of forest species’ seeds (gene bank), which is needed for scientific and research purposes, and facilitate inventory of unaccounted forest, which should clarify magnitude of land degradation problem in Kazakhstan. To further strengthen forest management capacity the project will support preparation of the forest management plans on selected areas of newly accounted forest in southern and south-western part of Kazakhstan in close proximity to the project area. Just in time technical assistance will be provided to the Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources to advance related policies and legislation depending on policy priorities at the project implementation period. The project will also work with the existing LDN workstreams and help establish additional ones as needed to support the development of an LDN strategy and targets for Kazakhstan. This component will also ensure regional cooperation, exchange of experience and dissemination of best practices within the GEF Drylands Impact Program and with neighboring countries. Component 3: Project coordination and monitoring (US$0.50 million)Component 3 will finance technical assistance, goods, training and the operating costs of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the FWC, which will coordinate the implementation of the project by managing and monitoring and evaluating the implementation of project work plans; ensure collaboration among stakeholders at national and local levels; report on progress and financial management performance to the World Bank; ensure timely external auditing of project accounts and the appropriateness of procurement and financial management tasks; and ensure adherence to and implementation of environmental and social measures as appropriate.

TRACE is a hybrid Trust Fund (TF), financed by a Dutch contribution of 13.5M Euros, and will be implemented over a period of four years. Its development objective is to create jobs in the agri-food sector by strengthening the productivity and resilience of small- scale producers, and competitiveness of agribusiness cooperatives and SMEs in selected agri-food sub- sectors through better access to knowledge, innovations and financial services. To stimulate job creation, TRACE will act on the following four dimensions/components: (1) stimulating the agri-entrepreneurship mindset and skills of rural people, especially youth and women; (2) expanding the network and professionalism of producer organizations (POs) and agri-SMEs able to connect producers to market opportunities and to required services; (3) developing the range and quality of financial and non-financial services for farmers, agribusiness SMEs, and value chain stakeholders; and, (4) improving the business environment and policy framework to stimulate the growth of a market-oriented and private sector-driven agri-food sector. Components 1, 3 and 4 are Bank-executed (BETF). Under component 2, it is proposed to establish a matching grant to help POs and SMEs develop their business and create more jobs. This matching grant will be implemented as a Recipient-executed Trust Fund (RETF) by a Tunisian Non-Governmental Organization, ENDA Inter-Arabe, selected through a competitive call for proposals.The RETF’s objective is to promote job creation and smallholder producer economic inclusion through the development and business growth of producer associations and cooperatives, young rural agri-entrepreneurs and agribusiness SMEs. The specific objective is to help them strengthen their technical competence, increase cooperation within and among POs, consolidate their financial viability, grow their existing business and grasp new business opportunities. More viable business development plan and strengthened skills will help sustain existing jobs. Business growth will generate additional jobs, both directly within these businesses but also indirectly among their suppliers and clients, increase resilience, and improve economic and social inclusion. It will also be instrumental to help small producers overcome the economic slowdown linked to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing technical and financial support to help them quickly resume production, processing and marketing once trade and movement restrictions are lifted.Supporting POs and rural SMEs will also facilitate the socio-economic inclusion of smallholder producers and strengthen the rural entrepreneurship mindset. POs in Tunisia are either Groupements de Developpement Agricole (GDAs - Agriculture Development Group) as primary level of producer association (non-for-profit) or Societes Mutuelles de Services Agricoles (SMSAs - Agriculture Services Co-ops) as cooperative-equivalent to deliver services to their members, including access to inputs, advisory services, post-harvest processing and marketing. Getting organized and receiving technical support will help small producers move from the business-as-usual production to more professional technique, moving from being aid-recipients or project-beneficiaries to become rural business entrepreneurs. By being exposed to more stringent quality and standard requirements, small producers will be able to progressively strengthen their professionalism. POs can facilitate the connection to markets and the introduction of know-how to innovate and follow higher standard requirements. This will also contribute to improve the overall supply chain efficiency.The RETF will consist of a matching grant to deliver grants to POs, SMEs and individual entrepreneurs to finance and implement investment projects to increase the productivity and profitability of their business, upgrade quality standards and strengthen their adaptation and resilience to climate change. Investment projects will fall under the following categories:- Farm production, covering crop and livestock intensification and diversification, including soft and small equipment investments in water use efficiency improvement and climate-smart agriculture;- Post-harvest operations, including soft investment, small equipment acquisition and small-scale works (small building rehab) for the storage, packing and processing of agriculture, forest and pasture produce; Range of produce will cover fruits and vegetables, forest medicinal and aromatic plants, honey, dairy, etc.;- Cultural and natural resources valorization through handy craft and rural tourism, including mainly soft investments, small equipment acquisition (no vehicle acquisition) and small-scale works (small building rehab);- Marketing, including market intelligence, advisory services for market prospect and contract negotiation, transport and shipment (no vehicle acquisition);- Advisory services, including support to individual coaches and advisors to establish consulting firms to deliver technical, managerial and marketing advice to agriculture and rural producers.",[],[],[],[],[],"['dairy', 'livestock', 'pasture', 'processing', 'smallholder']","['dairy', 'livestock', 'pasture', 'processing', 'smallholder']"

Like its predecessor, PRAPS-2 has been developed around five technical components, with the addition of focal areas that are essential to holistically address some of the core drivers of resilience among (agro)pastoral populations (see the Project Results Chain in Section D and Detailed Component Description in Annex 2). The proposed activities will be implemented over a six-year period. Each component will include complementary activities at the national and regional level, conforming to the principle of subsidiarity of interventions between regional and national levels. Institutional capacity building will be supported across components and activities to create an enabling environment to govern the sector in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner.Regional spillover impact of PRAPS-2 interventions. Sahelian (agro)pastoral systems rely on natural resources extending across national boundaries to accommodate climate variability and the seasonality of resources, and they also rely on regional market outlets (mainly in coastal countries) to move livestock and livestock products. At the same time, this activity increases vulnerability to contagious livestock diseases (also termed “transboundary” diseases). PRAPS-2 combines investments at the national level with coordination and support from regional institutions to generate benefits extending beyond the individual countries participating in the Project (regional public goods). These benefits include a reduction in animal health risks in countries that are transit areas or destinations for livestock (which helps to protect livestock capital throughout the region), a reduction in competition for natural resources (which reduces the risks of land degradation and conflict), and improved trade facilitation (which leads to greater economic gains), and overall greater regional stability. The proposed Project will play a major role in forging essential cross-sectoral and cross-border collaboration, and it will ensure synergies and complementarities—spatial and thematic—between Project investments and other ongoing and planned interventions.PRAPS-2 will prioritize geographic areas based on three principles. They are: (i) consolidating PRAPS-1 achievements in implementing natural resource and infrastructure governance mechanisms; (ii) reinforcing spatial coherence and clustering along key livestock mobility routes to increase synergies among interventions and avoid the dispersion of investments; and (iii) supporting cross-border cooperation and dialogue in the Sahel Region to tackle cross-border transhumance, regional trade, and planning along selected strategic livestock trade routes. Some interventions will be implemented nationwide, including those related to animal health, social inclusion, and institutional capacity building. Component 1: Animal health improvement and veterinary medicine control (US$125.3 million). The main outcome of this component will be increased capacity in VS to protect large and small ruminants from small ruminant plague (PPR) and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), two transboundary animal diseases that cause major losses throughout the region. The proposed Project will pursue investments initiated under PRAPS-1 to establish more robust animal health systems in beneficiary countries (Subcomponent 1.1), finance vaccination and surveillance campaigns primarily targeting PPR and CBPP (Subcomponent 1.2), and support quality control of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) (Subcomponent 1.3). Recognizing the highly contagious nature of PPR and CBPP and the public health threats of misusing VMPs and increasing antimicrobial resistance, this component will be implemented throughout the beneficiary countries, with critical infrastructure (veterinary posts, vaccination pens) being upgraded primarily in underserved pastoral areas. Component 2: Sustainable landscape management and governance enhancement (US$ 72.3 million)The main outcomes of Component 2 will be an increased area under sustainable landscape management and stronger governance of pastoral lands and livestock mobility, in compliance with agro-silvo-pastoral laws. Building on the legacy of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will further secure mobility and enhance access to natural resources (Subcomponent 2.1); finance the construction, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of essential water infrastructure (Subcomponent 2.2); and support fodder production (Subcomponent 3.3). These activities will enhance the resilience of pastoralists to climate risks and—by improving grazing management and livestock productivity—will improve soil carbon sequestration and reduce livestock emission intensities to mitigate climate change and provide additional ecosystem services. To the extent possible, Project investments will be directed at well-targeted transhumance routes and key livestock mobility corridors at the local, national, and cross-border level, to ensure the geographic concentration of activities and enable dialogue between adjacent cross-border communities in support of peaceful transhumance and resource use. Component 3: Livestock value chain improvement (US$ 59.4 million)The outcome of Component 3 will be improved pastoral livestock value chains (VCs), the facilitation of regional livestock trade, and better regional market integration. Building on the achievements of PRAPS-1, the proposed Project will continue to fill gaps in strategic market infrastructure along regional trade routes (Subcomponent 3.1), strengthen the capacities of national and regional producers' organizations (Subcomponent 3.2), and support innovative solutions for developing livestock VCs through subproject financing (Subcomponent 3.3). Activities under Subcomponents 3.1 and 3.3 will be prioritized along key regional trade routes where animals convoyed by foot move across borders to supply growing demand from markets in coastal countries.Component 4: Social and economic inclusion improvement, women and youth improvement (US$ 47.1 million)The outcome of Component 4 will be increased resilience as a result of expanding the socio-economic inclusion of pastoralists, particularly women and youth. PRAPS-1 successfully supported inclusion by improving access to skills training and technical and vocational training, and through direct support for the development of income-generating activities (IGAs). The proposed Project will provide continuity for these interventions by expanding access to technical and vocational training (Subcomponent 4.1) and IGAs (Subcomponent 4.3), focusing on a more structured approach for targeting young people and women. PRAPS-2 will also open a new area of work to promote the inclusion of pastoral populations in social and civil registries (Subcomponent 4.2). Component 5: Project coordination, institutional strengthening, and emergency prevention and response (US$ 73.3 million)Component 5 will focus on all aspects of Project management, including fiduciary management, safeguards, monitoring and evaluation, and communication (under Subcomponent 5.1). It will also support the development of institutional capacity (through adapted training as well as pastoral crisis prevention tools and procedures) and fill important knowledge and data gaps at the national and regional level (Subcomponent 5.2).

The nation-wide scale-up of the e-voucher distribution system makes subsidy distribution for high quality agricultural inputs (e.g. fertilizer and seeds) more efficient, transparent and resilient, which improves the productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers. Expanding the coverage of the main credit bureau will allow financial institutions to better assess risks and widen the pool of potential clients, particularly Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The second pillar seeks to build the crisis-adaptive capacity of the state, which - if it had been in place at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis - would have helped the Government respond faster and more effectively. For example, the One Health Technical Secretariat will provide the coordination framework that is so urgently needed.

The project is closely aligned with the Government of Turkey’s policy priorities and refugee response agenda of providing refugee and host communities access to sustainable livelihoods and employment in the agricultural sector. The proposed project builds on an approach that has proven successful in urban settings and adapts it to the agriculture sector. On the labor supply side, the project focuses on enhancing workers' skills through technical, soft skills and on the job training. For higher skilled, long term workers, the project provides a pathway to formalization. On the labor demand side, enhanced use of contract farming and provision of incentives (including wage subsidies) aims to increase farm productivity and boost formal on-farm and off-farm job creation. The project includes several innovative features tailored to the agriculture sector, including profiling of potential workers, assessment of skills demanded in the sector as well as development of tools to match workers and employers in a context characterized by high degrees of informality and a significant refugee population. The project includes a rigorous impact evaluation that will assess the impact of this approach on employers and workers.The project will be implemented in partnership with the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives (ACC), one of the largest farmer organizations in Turkey. The project design includes features to strengthen ACC's capacity to ensure effective project implementation, including monitoring and evaluation.The project is being processed under Paragraph 12, Project in Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraints, of the World Bank Investment Project Financing (IPF) Policy. The rationale for processing the project under the condensed procedures is the urgent need for assistance to support the Government of Turkey’s efforts to mitigate rising pressures on service delivery from the continual influx of refugees across the border, from camps to cities, and also on the urgent need to support refugees to become self-resilient and reliant through appropriate socio-economic integration tools. Currently, DGMM figures state that there are approximately 4 million refugees in Turkey with the majority originating from bordering Syria. Although most refugees are located in cities rather than camps, about 3 percent of refugees are located in camps. However, the government intends to close the camps and is transitioning people, except the most vulnerable, into cities gradually. This change poses various challenges to most cities in Turkey, already hosting thousands of refugees, including issues such as increased social tensions, increased service delivery pressures, and pressures on availability of resources.",[],[],[],[],[],"['processing', 'turkey']","['processing', 'turkey']"

Most of the people (85 percent) live in rural areas. The population growth rate is 2.8 percent per annum. At this growth rate, Malawi’s population will reach 23 million by 2025. The country is land-locked and is highly vulnerable to climatic shocks. Despite a recent difficult economic period, Malawi has a stable democratic political system and has initiated economic and political reforms. However, over half of its population is living in poverty. In 2017, poverty headcount at US$1.9/day (2011 PPP) remained stubbornly high at 70 percent of the population. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita was estimated at US$320 in 2017. Malawi is ranked 170 out of 188 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index, and 125 out of 157 on the World Bank’s Human Capital Index. Almost half (47 percent) of the children under age five in Malawi are short for their age due to long-term effects of malnutrition and 20 percent are severely stunted. Malawi’s economic growth rates have fallen below the average of 2.8 percent in non-resource rich African economies during the last twenty years. Real per capita, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown at an average of just above 1.5 percent per year between 1995 and 2014. With these persistent low growth rates, successive governments in Malawi have struggled to lift people out of poverty. Wealth accounting data shows that more than half of Malawi’s wealth (estimated at US$10,442 per capita in 2014) is renewable natural capital, mainly cropland with smaller shares contributed by pastureland, forests, and protected areas. The natural capital base, however, is under extreme pressure due to population growth, agricultural expansion, and climate change. Sectoral and Institutional Context Malawi’s water resources are under threat from severe land degradation and loss of forest cover. Critical watersheds are becoming degraded leading to reduced water availability, deteriorating water quality, increased vulnerability to droughts and floods, reduced energy security and reduced agricultural productivity. Malawi has a large network of surface water bodies covering about 21 percent of the country’s total area; about 20 percent of this area is Lake Malawi itself. The total renewable water resource available in Malawi is estimated at 17.3 km3/year, or 1,027 m3/capita/year. While the availability of water resources in the aggregate is considered satisfactory, per capita water availability has been declining at a rapid rate. Malawi is now dangerously close to becoming water scarce. Further, water resources in Malawi are highly variable between wet and dry seasons and from year to year, and the country’s stock of water storage infrastructure is one of the lowest in the region. GoM’s Water Resources Investment Strategy (WRIS, 2011) identifies poor catchment conditions and deteriorating water quality as significant risks to water resources and associated infrastructure (dams, hydropower plants, irrigation systems), and recommends investments in catchment management in strategically important WRAs. Land degradation in Malawi’s most important watersheds has reached alarming levels, with major impacts on water security, agricultural productivity, and hydropower generation. Recent studies suggest that land degradation hotspots cover about half (41 percent) of the land area in the country. Soil erosion and nutrient depletion are major forms of land degradation that are reported to affect more than 60 percent of the entire land area. The average annual national soil loss rate in 2014 was 29 tons per hectare. Chemical land degradation, including soil pollution and salinization/alkalization, has led to a 15 percent loss in the arable land in Malawi in the last decade alone. Projections for future land degradation and soil loss under different climate and population growth rate scenarios suggest that land degradation will become increasingly severe, with one study suggesting that overall rates of soil loss will increase by between three and four times 2010 baseline levels. The Shire River Basin remains the most prominent hotspot of land degradation. High loads of sediment are deposited in river beds, reservoirs and floodplain wetlands, affecting irrigation canals, fisheries and hydropower generation. Existing hydropower plants on the Shire River are often unable to meet peak demand, partly due to low flows and sediments in the river caused by degradation of catchments upstream of the plants. Forest degradation is a major contributor to land and water resources degradation. Over the last 40 years, more than half of Malawi’s forests and woodlands have vanished and those that remain are being ‘thinned’ through over-extraction and more frequent forest fires. Yet, forests make a substantial contribution to livelihoods and the economy and are needed to protect vital ecosystem services. They also provide the bulk of Malawi’s energy supply in the form of charcoal and firewood. Wood fuels dominate Malawi’s energy sector and are used by 98 percent of the population. The industry provides large numbers of jobs and is worth nearly US$295 million per annum – equivalent to four percent of GDP. Forests and woodlands also play a key role in protecting watersheds from erosion, sustain the biodiversity that underpins a large proportion of Malawi’s tourism sector and make an important contribution to mitigating carbon emissions. The underlying drivers of land degradation in Malawi are well known. These include growing demand for agricultural land and wood fuels associated with a growing population; imperfect knowledge about sustainable farming practices; insecure land tenure which reduces incentives to invest in soil and water conservation measures; and limited access to markets and rural finance. The proximate causes of land degradation include a wide range of biophysical factors and poor land management practices. Important biophysical factors that affect land degradation include topography, land cover, climate change and soil erodibility. Efforts to address land degradation are hampered by a multitude of factors. The major challenge is the weak institutional capacity for natural resource management at both national and local levels and the severe lack of funding for these activities in local government budgets. With insufficient resources, weak capacity, and incentives, local governments are generally unable to play an effective role in addressing land degradation at the local level. In addition, changes to climate and weather patterns exacerbate the impacts of natural resources degradation, making it harder to address the problem. Reversing the rate of land degradation remains a government priority. The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development (MoAIWD) and the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MoNREM) recognize the interdependence between natural resource management, agricultural production, water, and energy security. Sound policies and institutional frameworks for natural resources management exist. A new Environmental Management Act 2017 has been enacted to strengthen environmental management and protection, while the Water Resources Act of 2013 provides for the management, conservation, use and control of water resources, including management of watersheds. The recent establishment of the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA) is expected to help strengthen multi-sectoral planning and management of water resources in the country and pave the way for the establishment of sustainable watershed management institutions at the community level. Land reforms introduced in 2016 are expected to improve land tenure security and strengthen incentives for small-holder farmers and businesses to invest in sustainable land and water management practices.

The focus will be to increase on-farm and postharvest productivity and quality. The second subcomponent will benefit POs and MSMEs that are working directly with farmers in the same commodities to increase their competitiveness with focus on aggregation, logistics, processing, and marketing. This will ensure that aggregators and processors of smallholder produce can increase their absorption capacity and quality and therefore increase the competitiveness of the value chains. The two subcomponents complement each other to ensure that value chains and their stakeholders become more competitive across all segments. (4) Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation component will provide technical and operational assistance, including carrying out of training, to support the project management, implementation, M&E, FM, environmental and social safeguards, and communications functions of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and two PMUs. (5) Contingency Emergency Response Component will only be used in the event that an emergency response is required.",[],[],['livestock'],[],[],"['livestock', 'processing', 'smallholder']","['livestock', 'processing', 'smallholder']"

In the short and medium-term, the project will put into operation an inclusive agribusiness model based on productive alliances, formed between producers’ organizations (including indigenous communities), aggregators, agribusinesses and buyers. Producers will enhance their income-generating capacity by becoming more engaged in business activities, in close coordination with the final buyers/consumers and able to respond more effectively to market changes, while incorporating more climate-resilient technologies and approaches. In the long-term, the project will spark the creation of both on-farm and off-farms jobs and strengthen sectoral resilience, while contributing more significantly to human capital creation and economic development.",['market access'],[],['livestock'],[],[],[],"['livestock', 'market access']"
