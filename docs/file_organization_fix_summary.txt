FILE ORGANIZATION FIX SUMMARY
============================

ISSUE RESOLVED: ✅
=================
The file organization issue has been successfully fixed. All downloaded documents 
are now properly organized into their respective country folders.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============
1. **File Type Detection**: Updated the script to detect both lowercase and uppercase 
   file extensions (.pdf, .PDF, .docx, .DOCX, etc.)

2. **Project Number Extraction**: Enhanced the regex patterns to extract project 
   numbers from various filename formats (PE-L1187, CO-M1089, etc.)

3. **Operation Number Support**: Added support for operation numbers (ATN_ME-14908-PR, 
   ATN_ME-13560-CO) to properly map MIF Project Status Reports to their countries.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and status reporting during 
   the organization process.
